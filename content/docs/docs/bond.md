# Electricks Bond

## Introduction

Thank you for choosing Electricks Bond! You’re about to unbox an innovative tool that we believe will quickly become one of your go-to devices.

Bond has been meticulously designed to be highly compatible with PeekSmith 3. If you’re already familiar with PeekSmith, you’ll find the experience seamless. That said, Bond is still in its early stages, and while we’ve made great strides, some features are still in development. We’ve prepared a list of fully functional features, along with a roadmap for what’s coming next. Please note that standalone mode (Bond without a phone) is not yet available, but it’s on our radar.

Your Bond device comes with firmware version 0.0.7, and our team is already working on the next update. While we can’t share all the details just yet, we’re excited to bring you new features, with the next release targeted for the end of October.

For now, you can dive into a variety of tested features using the PeekSmith app. Explore vibrations, text messages, poker cards, color cards, and even web polling from dozens of sources. Peek at doodles or sketches from your impression pad, and use Bond’s touch screen to write letters on the swami screen, then send recognized text via an API call (for this, you’ll need “API + A.I. access” and text recognition credits). Most of these features should run smoothly right out of the box.

As for using Bond, the possibilities are vast. You can wear it on your wrist, palm it, or hide it — it’s up to you. Each approach has its own advantages, so feel free to experiment and find what fits best into your routine.

## Be Up-to-Date

It is important:

- for useful tips and details, read our documentation

- to get the latest features, keep updating the app and the firmware

## Begin Using Bond

Easy First Steps:

- charge the device: Use a wall charger, car adapter, or computer port. Avoid using overly powerful chargers. Make sure Bond is fully charged before your performance.

- reliable performance: Bond has impressive battery life and will support you throughout your performance.

- always on: Bond is always ready to use. Just keep it charged, and it’s good to go.

- no off switch: Bond is designed to last over a week in standby mode*, making it a reliable EDC (everyday carry) tool.

- screen protection: Remove the thin protective film from the screen before using the device.

 
* the week-long in standby mode mode is coming with a firmware update – currently it can work for 12-24 hours

Bond is ready to connect to a mobile app via Bluetooth.

## With the PeekSmith App

Visit [The App ](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-app/) page and follow the instructions to install the free companion app.

Start the app, and go to Settings. You will see different sections, in the first one, the “PeekSmith Device”, you should see a “Select PeekSmith” title and a “List devices” button. Press the button, and your Bond device should be listed there. Tap on the device name, and the device should connect. The Bond device will display a welcome message.

If your Bond device is not listed, please check these:

- Make sure Bluetooth is ON on your phone.

- Phones have a limit on the number of devices they can connect to. If you have more than 6 devices (a band, earphones, etc.) connected to your phone, try disconnecting them if you cannot connect to the watch. Modern phones are usually can connect to 10-16 devices at a time.

- Allow the app to use Bluetooth and/or Location Services.

- On Android, make sure the GPS is ON. While we are not tracking you, this is somehow a must-have for Bluetooth communication, too.

- On Android, Bluetooth has some bugs. You should try restarting the phone if you have any connection problems.

- You should not connect to Bond from your Bluetooth Settings, but the app will set up the connection.

- For more tips, you can read our[ Bluetooth Troubleshooting](https://electricks.info/docs/misc/troubleshooting-bluetooth/) guide.

 

Now you should see a green button with the “Details…” text, press it, and you can test your device.

There are different ways you can use your PeekSmith device now:

- Your assistant can use the PeekSmith app and can send you messages with it. The phone should be in the Bluetooth standard 10 meters / 11 yards range to be able to communicate with the device.

- You can use[ Web Polling](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/web-polling/) to retrieve data from other apps. For example, Inject 2 and WikiTest are popular magic apps, you can use them with Bond by going to “Display Web Data” in the PeekSmith app, turning on the “Read data from URL”, and selecting your “Data source”.

- The PeekSmith app can also watch any custom web URLs, so if a developer sets up a web URL, you can set it in the “Display Web Data” section, by selecting the “custom” data source.

- There’s a growing number of applications that can work with the device. We are listing them on the [Compatibility](https://electricks.info/docs/bond/compatibility/?) page. You should consult the app’s instructions about how to use it.

- On Android, you can set up catching mobile phone notifications as well (iOS doesn’t allow you to catch notifications because of privacy reasons). Any magic app that can send a notification can be used with the Bond device, just go to the Notifications section in the PeekSmith app, and turn on catching the notifications. You can test this feature by sending an email yourself or asking someone to text you / send you a chat message.

## Charging the Device

You can charge the device with the cradle you got it with, it has a USB-A plug. You can plug your device into your computer’s USB port, or a wall charger.

It is about 1-2 hours to charge your device to 100%. You will not damage the device by keeping it on the charger for the night.

There are two important notes:

- Don’t let the device totally discharge, as the battery can be damaged (it is true for any LiPo battery). At least charge it every month, even if you are not using it.

- Some “intelligent” chargers are not providing the 5V constantly, but trying to detect if a device is plugged in. If they were designed for mobile phones with 1A/2A charging, they might not detect Bond’s 100 mA need, and won’t charge.

- You can use any 5V charger, even 100W laptop charger. They don’t overload the device.

- Bond displays a charging indicator screen* when it is on the charger.

* this may be buggy with firmware 0.0.7

## Troubleshooting

For first-time users, some tips to know:

- The PeekSmith app should be in the front to work. You should not lock the screen, or switch to another app. There’s an option in Other Settings: “Turn OFF screen when covered”. If you enable it, the app will turn off the screen if it detects something in front of your screen (like your pocket). You can use it instead of locking the screen.

- The Bond device (and typically any other Bluetooth device) can connect only to one application. If the device is ON, connected to the PeekSmith app, then other compatible apps won’t be able to list and connect to it.

## Further Advice

Bond is designed to perform well in typical room conditions. To clean the screen, simply wipe it with a soft, damp cloth to remove any dirt or smudges.
