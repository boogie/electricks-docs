# Atom

Atom is a powerful tool that lets you display predictions and visuals on your Teleport device— without needing a phone during performance. It’s fast, discreet, and built with mini-apps that support a wide range of routines.
Teleport integration is built directly into Atom’s mini-apps . Once enabled, Atom can send predictions wirelessly to your Teleport screen, making your performance even more seamless and self-contained.

## Getting Started with Atom and Teleport

Before using Atom with Teleport:

- Make sure your Teleport is powered on .

- On Atom, open the desired mini-app (e.g., Atom Time, Stack, or Square).

- Enable Teleport output from the mini-app’s settings (usually under the settings gear icon or by long-pressing the menu).

- Once enabled, your prediction will automatically be sent to Teleport when triggered—no phone required.
