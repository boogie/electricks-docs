# ESP Card Reveal

The ESP Card screen lets you display one of the five classic ESP symbols on your Teleport device. You can either choose the symbol yourself or let it appear as part of a prediction routine.

This makes it a flexible tool for mentalism effects, experiments with perception, or demonstrations of ‚Äúextra-sensory perception.‚Äù

### How it Works

- Open the PeekSmith app.
- Navigate to the ESP Card screen.
- Choose one of the five symbols (circle, cross, wavy lines, square, star).
- If a Teleport is connected, a ‚ÄúSend to Teleport‚Äù toggle will appear. Turn it on.
- Tap a symbol (or select it with a connected remote such as Atom, ATC, or MATT+).
- The chosen symbol is displayed on your Teleport device.

### Performance Ideas

- Use a deck of marked ESP cards and force a symbol, then reveal the matching image on Teleport.
- Let your assistant secretly choose the matching symbol in the app while the spectator believes their choice is free.

### Tips
