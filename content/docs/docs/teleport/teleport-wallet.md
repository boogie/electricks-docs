# Teleport Wallet

The [Teleport Wallet](https://electricks.info/product/teleport-wallet/) is a custom-designed leather accessory created to house your Teleport device securely and discreetly. Handcrafted by The Mind Hacker Tony Antoniou, it allows you to carry Teleport naturally as part of your everyday items while protecting it from wear and tear.

Unlike the included neck holder, which keeps Teleport visible and accessible, the wallet option conceals the device inside a familiar, slim profile. This makes it perfect for performers who want Teleport to blend seamlessly into their act, ready to be revealed only at the perfect moment.

### Why Performers Use It

- Natural disguise – Looks and feels like a normal wallet, hiding Teleport in plain sight.

- Expands your effects – The layout works beautifully with tilted images and routines that benefit from concealment.

- Performance-ready – Protects your device while keeping it usable at a moment’s notice.

- Crafted for professionals – Built from premium 0.6mm leather, ensuring durability without adding bulk.

### Specifications

- Material: Genuine 0.6mm hand-stitched leather

The Teleport Wallet is more than a carrying case – it’s a performance tool. It protects your investment, keeps your setup natural, and unlocks new ways to astonish your audience with Teleport.
