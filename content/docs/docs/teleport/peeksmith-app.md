The PeekSmith app is a universal tool – it connects to PeekSmith as well as a variety of other devices, such as the Quantum Calculator.

## First Steps

Once you launched the app, a label might appear that an update is available. Always update the PeekSmith app to the latest (make sure, you have at least v6.2.34). You also need to login with your Apple or Google account, otherwise some features may be missing.

Here’s how to connect your Teleport device to the PeekSmith app:

- Turn on your Teleport device.

- Open the PeekSmith app on your phone.

- Tap the gear icon to go to the Settings screen.

- In the first Connect Devices section, look for Teleport.

- Tap List Device and choose your Teleport from the list.

- Pairing complete!

Note: To send data (like text or drawings) to Teleport, you’ll also need a compatible device (like the [SB Mote](https://electricks.info/docs/sbmote/)) connected to your phone via Bluetooth. This acts as the input controller for your performance.
