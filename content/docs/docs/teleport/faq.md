## What Is the Retail Price of Teleport? How Can I Place an Order?

The price of the [Teleport](https://electricks.info/product/teleport/) is $397 – $497Price range: $397 through $497. Please read our [Shipping](https://electricks.info/shipping/) page for details about VAT and customs fees. You can buy them in our Electricks Magic Shop. Please visit the [Teleport](https://electricks.info/product/teleport/) product page.

## What Is the Trick?

Teleport is a card-shaped color e-ink display without a backlight. When placed in its holder, it appears just like paper. You can use it to reveal color predictions – including cards, photos, and writing – or create the illusion of teleporting a card into the holder. The device can be controlled through our Atom Remote or the PeekSmith app.

It’s important to note that Teleport is not a magic trick in itself – it’s a versatile tool that can enhance your performance in countless ways. Like any prop in magic, its effectiveness depends on how creatively you incorporate it into your routines and presentations.

You can use Teleport for classic effects like predictions and reveals, but you can also develop new routines that weren’t possible before. The device’s ability to display different types of content opens up many creative possibilities for both close-up and stage performances.

## Does Teleport Look Suspicious?

On its own, it might stand out – but once placed in its holder, it blends in seamlessly. It looks just like printed paper with text and graphics.

## What is TrueWrite and why is it special?

TrueWrite is our breakthrough neural handwriting engine that makes digital text look genuinely handwritten. Unlike fonts that repeat the same letter shapes, TrueWrite creates unique variations for every character – just like real handwriting.

Now it comes FREE with Teleport and includes three styles: Marker, Post-it, and Chalk. This means your reveals can look like handwritten notes, sticky notes, or chalkboard writing – perfect for mentalism and predictions that need to feel authentic.

## What Are the Dimensions of the Device?

The dimensions of Teleport, without the neck badge holder, are 57 mm × 100 mm × 4 mm.

## What Kind of Battery Does Teleport Use?

Teleport is powered by a rechargeable lithium-polymer (Li-Po) battery, designed for long-lasting performance and efficient power management.

## What Does "Incredibly Long Battery Life" Mean?

We’re still gathering real-world data – we don’t want to mislead you. What we can say is this: we’ve only charged our test devices once, and they’re still running. In standby mode (Bluetooth ON), battery life should last months. In active use, it may handle more than thousands of screen updates.

Theoretically, it could be even better.

## How Do I Charge It?

Teleport has a built-in LiPo battery and charges wirelessly using any standard Qi charger. A full charge takes approximately 1-2 hours.

## What Is in the Box?

You’ll receive:

- Teleport device

- Qi wireless charger (with USB-A to USB-C cable)

- Neck badge holder (designed to fit Teleport perfectly)

## Is it a Standalone Effect?

Teleport works seamlessly with the (free) PeekSmith app or Atom. While it’s not a standalone effect, it integrates smoothly with these tools to enhance your magic.

We’re also open to new integrations and eager to collaborate with magic app developers to expand its possibilities!

## What Are the Features?

We recommend reading the documentation, as we have a growing list of features:

- [PeekSmith app](https://electricks.info/docs/teleport/peeksmith-app/) features

- [Atom remote](https://electricks.info/docs/teleport/atom-2/) features

## Is It Only for Poker Cards? Can It Display Text, Signed Cards, or Photos?

Teleport is powered by the PeekSmith app, and it’s not limited to just poker cards. We’re planning to support signed cards, text, and any images from other apps, giving you complete flexibility in how you use it!

## How Does Teleport Handle Signed Cards?

Our plan is to use impression pad writings as the source. The PeekSmith app already supports multiple impression boards, allowing the captured handwriting to be layered directly onto a card image.

This means you could take a signature, message, or drawing from an impression pad and seamlessly overlay it onto a displayed card, creating the perfect illusion of a signed card.

## Can It Be Used as a Peek Device?

Yes, but it’s not the best option for peeking. For that, we recommend PeekSmith and Bond for a smoother experience.

## Do You Have Videos?

Yes, our documentation have tutorial videos.

## Will It Display Impression Pad Writings/Drawings?

The PeekSmith app is compatible with several impression pads available on the market and will display their inputs. However, Teleport itself will not communicate directly with these impression pads.

## How Many Colors Does the E-Ink Display Support, and What Are Its Specifications?

The display supports four colors: white, black, red, and yellow. The display’s resolution is 240 x 416 pixels, roughly 133 dpi.

This allows us to display playing cards, predictions, and other visual content with sufficient detail while maintaining the paper-like appearance that’s crucial for magical effects. The combination of these colors enables a wide range of visual possibilities while ensuring the display remains convincing and natural-looking in performance conditions.

## How Long Does It Take to Update the Screen?

While traditional color e-ink screens can be slow to refresh, Teleport brings you the latest, updating in just 20 seconds. That’s fast for color e-ink and just great for our applications. You can enjoy the benefits of a power-free, crystal-clear screen with the added versatility of color.

## Why Did You Choose a Holder That Covers the Sides of the Cards?

Actually, it’s the other way around – the window size is determined by the dimensions of the e-ink display. We carefully selected the best e-ink display available, but since these displays come in fixed sizes, the window had to match it.

If you prefer to see the pip numbers, there are a few workarounds:

- Shift the image slightly to the left or right (we may apply this to the default images).

- Use a photo of a bridge-sized card for a better fit.

- Reduce the image size to reveal more of the card.

These small tweaks can help you get the exact look you want!
