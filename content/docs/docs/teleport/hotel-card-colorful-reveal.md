# Hotel Card (Colorful) Reveal

The Hotel Card (Colorful) generator creates a vibrant hotel key card image on your Teleport device. You can personalize it with the hotel name, room number, and other details ‚Äì making it a versatile reveal for predictions and routines with a travel theme.

### How it Works

- Open the PeekSmith app.
- Go to Settings ‚Ä∫ Action Control.
- Set ‚ÄúNew text added to buffer‚Äù to Special ‚Ä∫ Fetch to Teleport.
- In the input field, enter this URL: https://teleport.electricks.info/room.php?hotel=HILTON&room=#TEXT
- When text is sent to the app (from a remote, Quantum, ATC, MATT+, or text recognition), the #TEXT part is replaced with the chosen room number.
- Teleport downloads the card and displays it instantly.

### Example

- Sending ‚Äú237‚Äù with the URL above shows a Hilton-branded hotel card for Room 237.
- You can replace HILTON with any hotel name, and even customize other fields in the URL.

### Performance Ideas

- Create a list of room numbers in the Predefined Text screen (../predefined-text/), so you can select them quickly.
- Let your spectator ‚Äúimagine‚Äù staying at a hotel and name a random room number ‚Äì then reveal their thought-of number printed on a card.
- Use an impression pad or handwriting recognition to collect the room number secretly.

### Tips

üí° Tip: Try customizing the hotel name to match your story or the event venue.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Stick to shorter hotel names for the cleanest look on Teleport.
