# Hand Drawn ESP

The Hand Drawn ESP Card lets you display one of the six classic ESP symbols on your Teleport device.

This makes it a flexible tool for mentalism effects, experiments with perception, or demonstrations of ‚Äúextra-sensory perception.‚Äù

### How it Works

- Open the PeekSmith app.

- Go to Settings ‚Ä∫ Action Control.

- Set ‚ÄúNew text added to buffer‚Äù to Special ‚Ä∫ Fetch to Teleport.

- In the input field, enter this URL: https://teleport.electricks.info/esp/#TEXT.png

- When text (circle, cross, wavy lines, square, star, infinity) is sent to the app (from a remote, Quantum, ATC, MATT+, or text recognition), the #TEXT part is replaced with the chosen Hand Drawn ESP.

- Teleport downloads the ESP and displays it instantly.

- Use a deck of marked ESP cards and force a symbol, then reveal the matching image on Teleport.
- Let your assistant secretly choose the matching symbol in the app while the spectator believes their choice is free.

### Tips
