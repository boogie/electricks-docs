# Doodle Drawing

The Doodle Drawing routine allows you to reveal an exact replica of a spectator’s drawing – right on your Teleport screen. It can be created on an impression pad or drawn with a finger in the PeekSmith app.

We recommend combining it with text recognition, and revealing the prediction in a [hand-written](https://electricks.info/docs/teleport/handwritten-text/) form.

In our video demo, we used the Doodle screen in the app to draw by hand, but the feature also works with supported impression pads.

## Setting Up the Doodle Routine

Just like with Handwritten Text, this routine requires a trigger (SBMote, Atom, PeekSmith 3, or another compatible device) to send the drawing once it’s ready.

Step 1: Configure Action Control
To send the drawing to Teleport, you’ll need to assign a trigger to perform the send action.

- Go to Settings in the PeekSmith app.

- Scroll down to Action Control .

- Enable Monitor Volume Button , or configure a compatible button (like on SB Mote, Atom, or PeekSmith 3).

- Under the desired action (e.g., Volume Up or a device button), select Doodle to Teleport .

You can also assign this action by opening the “Details…” page of your remote device and choosing the appropriate trigger.

Step 2: Open the Doodle Screen

- Open the PeekSmith app.

- Navigate to the Doodle screen from the main menu (it’s on the Play screen).

- You can draw directly with your finger , oruse a connected impression pad if supported.

- The drawing appears live within the app, giving you real-time feedback as the spectator creates it.

Step 3: Perform the Reveal

- Once the drawing is complete, press the assigned button .

- The full drawing is sent and displayed on the Telepor t screen exactly as it was created.
