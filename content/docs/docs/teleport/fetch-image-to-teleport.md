# Fetch image to Teleport

With the Fetch Image to Teleport action, you can instantly display customized images on your Teleport device. Instead of sending plain text, the PeekSmith app can download an image from the internet, adapt it with your chosen data (text, numbers, cards, etc.), and send it directly to Teleport.

This makes your reveals more visual and flexible – perfect for predictions, travel themes, or unique routines.

### How it Works

- Open the PeekSmith app.
- Go to Settings › Action Control.
- Set the action for “New text added to buffer” to Special › Fetch to Teleport.
- Enter the URL of your chosen image template (examples below).
- Whenever new text is sent to the app (from a remote, Quantum, ATC, MATT+, or even handwriting recognition), the image is automatically downloaded and displayed on Teleport.
