# Poker Card Image

This is the easiest way to try Teleport with the PeekSmith app. This feature lets you reveal a playing card on your Teleport screen in a bold, visual way. With just a few taps in the PeekSmith app, you can display any standard poker card using suit and value selection – no need for an external trigger or extra device setup.

Your assistant can use this feature to send cards during a performance.

This is ideal for mind-reading, card forces , and prediction effects when you or an assistant can use the application to enter the card.
