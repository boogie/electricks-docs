# Atom Card

Enter a **playing card** into Atom. **It can be **sent to Teleport** in several formats:

- **Poker** (standard playing card layout)

- **Bridge** (narrow format)

- **Tilted Poker** (for more natural-looking reveals)

Great for **stacked deck reveals** or **card predictions**.

### How it Works**

- Install the Preview firmware (v2.4.1) to Atom in the [MagiScript editor](https://peeksmith.electricks.info/atom/)

- Make sure that **Atom **and **Teleport **are charged

- To launch the app, turn on Atom and press button #2  during the 5‑sec launch window (while the LED is cyan) It will connect to Teleport automatically.

- If you use it for the first time you need to change some settings in the PeekSmith App or in the MagiScript editor.

- In the PeekSmith App go to the Settings than connect to Atom under the CONNECT DEVICES tab, if you connected press Details than press Device Settings scroll down to ATOM STACK

- Open the [MagiScript editor](https://peeksmith.electricks.info/atom/) and connect your Atom. Press Atom Settings than go to Mini-Apps Follow the [Editor Basics](https://peeksmith.electricks.info/atom/) guide if you need more details.
