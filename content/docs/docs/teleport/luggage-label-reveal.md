# Luggage Label Reveal

The Luggage Label generator lets you display a realistic airline tag on your Teleport device. You simply provide a 3-letter IATA airport code, and the system creates a luggage label with the airport and city name. Perfect for travel-themed routines, predictions, and mind-reading effects.

### How it works

- ¬†Open the PeekSmith app.
- Go to Settings ‚Ä∫ Action Control.
- Set ‚ÄúNew text added to buffer‚Äù to Special ‚Ä∫ Fetch to Teleport.
- In the input field, enter this URL: https://teleport.electricks.info/luggage.php?iata=#TEXT
- When text is sent to the app (from a remote, Quantum, ATC, MATT+, or text recognition), the #TEXT part is replaced with the chosen airport code.
- Teleport downloads the luggage tag image and displays it instantly.

### Example

- If you send ‚ÄúMAN‚Äù, Teleport shows a luggage tag for Manchester Airport.
- If you send ‚ÄúJFK‚Äù, Teleport shows a luggage tag for New York (John F. Kennedy Airport).

You can replace or customize other fields in the URL as well ‚Äì city, airport name, or additional text.

### Performance ideas

- Prepare a list of airport codes in the Predefined Text screen (../predefined-text/) for quick access.
- Let your spectator freely choose an airport, type the code on a remote (Atom, ATC, MATT+), and reveal the matching luggage label.
- Combine with an impression pad or handwriting recognition for a hands-off miracle.

### Tips

üí° Tip: Use well-known airports (e.g., JFK, LAX, LHR) for maximum spectator recognition.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Make sure you test the codes you want to use in advance, so you know how the labels will look.
