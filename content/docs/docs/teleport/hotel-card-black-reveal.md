# Hotel Card (Black) Reveal

The Hotel Card (Black) generator produces a sleek, minimalist hotel key card image on your Teleport device. It shows the hotel name and room number, and can be easily customized to fit your story or routine.

### How it Works

- Open the PeekSmith app.
- Go to Settings ‚Ä∫ Action Control.
- Set ‚ÄúNew text added to buffer‚Äù to Special ‚Ä∫ Fetch to Teleport.
- In the input field, enter this URL: https://teleport.electricks.info/room2.php?hotel=HILTON&room=#TEXT
- When text is sent to the app (from a remote, Quantum, ATC, MATT+, or text recognition), the #TEXT part is replaced with the chosen room number.
- Teleport downloads the hotel card and displays it instantly.

### Example

- Sending ‚Äú305‚Äù with the URL above shows a Hilton-branded black hotel card for Room 305.
- Replace HILTON with any hotel name you like.
