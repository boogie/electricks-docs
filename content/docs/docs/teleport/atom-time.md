# Atom Time

- Originally designed to set the time on compatible watches .

- Also supports revealing a drawn clock on Teleport or showing a pocket watch image as a prediction.

Choose the output format within the mini-app before triggering.

### How it Works

- Install the Preview firmware (v2.4.1) to Atom in the [MagiScript editor](https://peeksmith.electricks.info/atom/)

- Make sure that Atom and Teleport are charged

- To launch the app, turn on Atom and press button #1 (top-left) in 5 seconds (while the LED is cyan). It will connect to Teleport automatically.

- If you use it for the first time you need to change some settings in the PeekSmith App or in the MagiScript editor.

- In the PeekSmith App go to the Settings than connect to Atom under the CONNECT DEVICES tab, if you connected press Details than press Device Settings scroll down to ATOM TIME

- Open the [MagiScript editor](https://peeksmith.electricks.info/atom/) and connect your Atom. Press Atom Settings than go to Mini-Apps. Follow the [Editor Basics](https://peeksmith.electricks.info/atom/) guide if you need more details.

 

### Send to Teleport

- Off – It won’t send anything to Teleport

- Pocket Watch Pic – It will send a picture to Teleport by a pocket watch(It can only send a picture of 30 minutes only times like 00;30)

- Hand Drawn Clock – It will send a picture to Teleport by a Hand Drawn Clock

### Enter Time

- Now you can type a time . To set 5:00, press 5. By default, Atom will set the time after 3 seconds , but you can press the bottom-left “submit” button (#10) to send it immediately. To set 7:14, type 7, 1, 4.

- If you need to correct the time  you entered use the bottom right (#12) button for deleting the last digit.

- You can also reset the time  to the actual time. Enter 4444 or 9999, or long-press any of the buttons.
