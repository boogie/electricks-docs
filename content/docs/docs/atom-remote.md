Atom 2 is a revolution. Designed with cutting-edge technology, it’s the smartest remote on the market, featuring dozens of mini-apps and seamless connectivity with many Bluetooth magic devices. It features:

- 12 silent buttons (usable through your pocket) and a multi-purpose power button

- RGB LED for status indication and MagiScript mini-apps

- Motion intelligence with a built-in accelerometer

- Fine-tuned Bluetooth range for reliable performance

Atom 2 works on its own or with Bluetooth devices like [ PeekSmith ](https://electricks.info/product/peeksmith-3/) or [ Bond ](https://electricks.info/product/bond/) for peeking, [SB Watch](https://electricks.info/product-category/sbwatch/), and other hybrid watches for time reveals, and PeriPage, [Cosmos wallet printers](https://electricks.info/product/cosmos-physical-prediction/), and [Teleport e-ink display](https://electricks.info/product/teleport/) for physical predictions.

Atom is supported in many magic apps and can function as a versatile Bluetooth keyboard , allowing you to enter numbers, text, or even control media and act as a mouse.

With MagiScript support , Atom 2 unlocks endless possibilities – there are no limits!

## MagiScript

Atom is our first device to have MagiScript (read [MagiScript documentation](https://electricks.info/docs/magiscript/)), so you can create mini-apps running on the device without an internet connection or phone. You can write your own mini-apps, or run mini-apps created by the community. We offer dozens of built-in mini-apps as well.

## Be Up-to-Date

It is important:

- for useful tips and details, read our documentation

- to get the latest features, keep updating the apps and [the firmware](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/firmware-upgrade/) *this documentation is always about the latest firmware and app versions*

- stay updated, and share your ideas in the[ Atom Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/atomremote) and/or in the [MagiScript Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/magiscript)

## Turning Atom ON and OFF

Easy first steps:

- charge the device : wall chargers, car connectors, and computer ports should work (some powerful chargers might not) — make it charged before a performance

- turn it on : disconnect the charger, then press and hold the power button (on the back of the device) – will vibrate, and the LED turns to cyan for 5 seconds (indication of “launch mode”)

- turn it off : press and hold the power button – after a few seconds the LED turns red, Atom vibrates and turns off

If the Atom’s LED blinks yellow three times when you try to turn it on, it means the battery is low. Charge it for an hour, and it will be ready to use. Please note that you cannot turn it on while it is charging.

## Mini-Apps

Mini-apps are basic applications running on Atom. They do not necessarily need a phone but can control other Bluetooth devices like PeekSmith 3 or SB Watch. Atom includes dozens of built-in mini-apps, and you can create and install more.

We have detailed documentation about the[ built-in mini-apps](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/built-in-mini-apps/).

## Bluetooth Keyboard(s)

Atom 2 can function as a Bluetooth keyboard , allowing you to enter information in any application. This feature is powered by keyboard mini-apps – simply launch the one you need (there are five available), such as the [numeric keyboard](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/numeric-keyboard/) for number entry.

When using Atom as a Bluetooth keyboard with an iPhone , the onscreen keyboard typically hides. However, while Atom is in keyboard mode and paired with your device, you can toggle the onscreen keyboard by tapping Atom’s power button.

## Launcher

When Atom starts, it enters launch mode , giving you 5 seconds to start a mini-app by pressing one of the buttons (#1–#11) . You can return to launch mode at any time by double-clicking the power button , which will again give you 5 seconds to select a mini-app.

Launch mode is indicated by a cyan LED light.

To set a mini-app to launch automatically when turning on Atom, press and hold the power button , then press the button of the mini-app you want to assign. Be careful not to hold the power button too long, as this will turn off Atom.

## Battery

Currently Atom can work for 3 hours with full-charge. You can easily turn it on and off during a performance to save battery. We plan to improve the battery life with a firmware update.

Atom is using 3 colors to give you feedback about the battery. Plug it in, and you will see yellow, red or green color, which means low, in-progress, charged states.

If you see that Atom blinks yellow and turns off, it means the battery is low.

## Next Steps

Visit our[ compatibility page](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/compatibility/) for information about using the device with our apps. There are already many apps supporting Atom, but we are working on other apps and with magic app developers to increase the list of compatible apps.

[Firmware updates](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/firmware-upgrade/) are available in the free PeekSmith app, and also in our [web browser-based MagiScript editor](https://msedit.electricks.info/) you can also use to configure Atom, and to create MagiScript mini-apps.

And finally, you can[ start learning MagiScript](https://electricks.info/docs/magiscript/) as well.

## Atom 1 is Deprecated

Atom 1 is not ideal for every situation, and we are not supporting it anymore (we have offered a free upgrade program). Low battery might freeze Atom 1. Unplug it, wait until it goes out of battery (3 days), and turn it on. If not start, remove it from the charger immediately, and try it later. If turns on, charge it until it is full.
