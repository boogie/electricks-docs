# SB Watch 2

[alert:danger]Do You Have an SB Watch 1?|Please read our dedicated [SB Watch documentation](https://electricks.info/docs/sbwatch/).[/alert]

## Unboxing the SB Watch 2

Congratulations on your SB Watch 2! If you own an SB Watch 1 model (2020, 2021, and 2022 editions, the Steel wristwatch, and our pocket watches), please read our dedicated [SB Watch documentation](https://electricks.info/docs/sbwatch/).

Congratulations on having your SB Watch 2. We hope you will like our watch, the perfect companion for the TimeSmith app. We wish you many successful performances that will amaze your audience.

The SB Watch 2 models include a charger, a charging cable and a screen wipe clothe as well.

We recommend joining our [TimeSmith Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/timesmith) for updates and discussing your ideas. It is a welcoming and active community you will love. üôÇ

We have collected a lot of information on this page about charging and troubleshooting. Please read them all.

## First Steps

SB Watch 2 is¬†merging the prediction watch capabilities with the electronic peeking features akin to PeekSmith. While our documentation is still in progress, rest assured that the guidelines for SB Watch seamlessly apply to SB Watch 2. To leverage the tiny screen‚Äôs potential, users will need to engage with the PeekSmith app. The PeekSmith app is free, and provides integrations with several sources.

## Charging

Before you use it for the first time, put the watch on the charger it came with, and charge it fully, which takes about an hour.

üí° Make sure you remove the protection foil from the back of the watch, and place the watch on the charger (the back should touch the flexible ‚Äúbutton‚Äù of the charger). The watch will indicate charging as you place it on the charger.

The SB Watch 2 has a rechargeable battery that can keep it running for about a week, and you don‚Äôt need to open the back to replace the battery.

## Standalone Mode

The watch gives you a basic force routine when it‚Äôs not connected to any app, phone, or remote. You *will be* able to configure it in the TimeSmith app. By default, if you turn the watch face down (like when someone holds it), and then quickly press the crown, it sets the time to 7:14. To go back to the current time, just press and hold the crown for a while, no matter which way the watch is facing. See the ‚Äú[Be the Force With You](/docs/sbwatch/be-the-force-with-you/)‚Äù routine for presentation details.

## Peeking Information

First of all, please [install the PeekSmith app](https://peeksmith.info/peeksmith-app). Start the app, and go to Settings. You will see different sections, in the first one, the ‚ÄúCONNECT DEVICES‚Äù, you should see an ‚ÄúSB Watch 2‚Äù title and a ‚ÄúList devices‚Äù button. Tap the button, and your watch should be listed there. Tap on the device name, and it should connect, and display a ‚ÄúREADY‚Äù message on its screen.¬†Please note that the watch can only be connected to one app or remote at a time, which means if you would like to connect it from the TimeSmith or an other app, or an Atom or other remote, you need to exit in the PeekSmith app first.

Try sending messages to the watch by going to the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù page, and selecting ‚Äúsend text‚Äù, ‚Äúpoker cards‚Äù or ‚Äúcolors‚Äù. This is how your assistant can send you messages. Read our docs about ‚Äú[Web Polling](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/web-polling/)‚Äù in the PeekSmith documentation for setting up other sources.

By default, the watch activates message display when you raise your hand to ‚Äúcheck the time‚Äù. This *will be* configurable in the PeekSmith app. Ensure that your hand is positioned to shield the screen from onlookers, and the message will appear. Once you lower your hand, the message will vanish. The watch retains messages for a duration of 30 seconds.

## Future Updates

Presently, the screen accommodates textual information (2 rows, 6 letters per row), with our team exploring the possibility extending it to 7 or 8 letters per row, and incorporating drawings (these will come with firmware updates).

A select group of developers have received watches to integrate them into their apps. Any application with SB Watch support is fully compatible with SB Watch 2. Additionally, integrating the peeking functionality into existing apps supporting our devices requires minimal development effort, offering expanded possibilities for engagement.
