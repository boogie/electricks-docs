# Hiding the Scale

## Hide in a Card Box

To get ready, start by making a box out of a poker card box to hide the scale. Cut off the box’s bottom and cover the scale. Make sure the box isn’t touching the table on all four sides. Trim the sides of the box by about 1-2mm, but be careful not to cut too much, or people might notice the trick.
