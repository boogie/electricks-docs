# Card Stacks Reading

## Introduction

This routine showcases the capabilities of our intelligent scale, SoulMate, in conjunction with various stacked decks. The performer aims to astound by apparently delving into the minds of the audience, accurately identifying their chosen cards, and even tallying their quantity.

## Usage 1

- Go to the menu and select the St Stebbins mode.

- While there is nothing on the scale, press the button once long until the display shows “tare” to save the basic position of the scale.

- Cut the deck somewhere and put what you cut on the scale.

- On the left side of the display, you will see the card, which is the bottom card of the deck on the scale, in the middle , how many cards are on the scale, and on the right side , which is the top card in your hand.

- If you short-press the button once , the number will be underlined in the middle, and in this case, it will show how many cards are left in your hand .

## Usage 2

- Go to the menu and select the St Stebbins mode .

- Put the whole deck of cards on the scale and press the button one long until the display shows “tare” to save the weight of the cards.

- Cut the deck somewhere and put what you cut on the scale.

- On the left side of the display, you will see the card that is the bottom card in your hand, in the middle is the number of cards in your hand, and on the right side is the card, that is the top card of the deck on the scale.

- If you short-press the button once , the number will be underlined in the middle, and in this case, it will write as many cards, as there are on the scale.

## Performance

1: Setup: You call a spectator onto the stage and ask them to lift the deck somewhere and take a look at the top card – that will be their chosen card.

2: Revelation: Harness the power of the SoulMate scale to not just reveal the spectator’s card but also effortlessly discern the precise number of cards they lifted.

## Solution

You place the deck, lifted by the spectator, onto a concealed SoulMate (for example inside a cardbox) that understands the stack’s order and identifies the spectator’s chosen card. As soon as the deck is on the SoulMate, it instantly reveals the chosen card and counts the number of cards in the deck, allowing you to determine how many cards the spectator lifted.

## Tips

For a more dramatic effect, the spectator can count the lifted cards, proving that you correctly stated the number of cards.
