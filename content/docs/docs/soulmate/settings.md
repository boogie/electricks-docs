# Settings

## What Can be Configured in the Settings Menu?

You can adjust two things:

- contrast (the brightness of the display)

- sleep mode

## Contrast

Choose the one you prefer:

- contrast 10% (least lit)

- contrast 50% (moderately lit)

- contrast 100% (best lit)

## Sleep Mode

The SoulPeek Display can go into sleep mode , but only if there is nothing on the scale and it shows 0 , or if there is something on the scale but it is saved and therefore the display also shows 0 in the middle. If the balance has some extra weight in the meantime and the display does not show 0 in the middle, it will not go into sleep mode. If you’re on the menu, it won’t go to sleep there too.

Choose the one you prefer:

- sleep 1 min: It goes into sleep mode on its own after 1 minute

- sleep 10 min: It goes into sleep mode on its own after 10 minute

- sleep 30 min: It goes into sleep mode on its own after 30 minute

- sleep OFF: turns off after discharged
