# Equal Weight Objects

## Introduction

This routine highlights the remarkable capabilities of our intelligent scale, SoulMate, in coordination with various selected items such as candies or coins. The performerâ€™s objective is to amaze the audience by seemingly diving into their thoughts, accurately determining the quantity of the chosen items.

## Performance

1: Setup: Invite a participant to select a handful of candies or coins from the provided selection. They can examine and hold these items in their hand.

2: Revelation: Utilize the SoulMate to unveil the exact quantity of items.

## Solution

You place the handful of candies or coins, chosen by the participant, onto the concealed SoulMate (for example, within a designated cardbox). This intelligent scale recognizes the exact quantity of items placed on its surface.
