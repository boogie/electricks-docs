## Using Your Dice with the DiceSmith App

Please check these before trying to connect the dice from the DiceSmith app:

- Make sure Bluetooth is ON on your phone.

- Phones have a limit on the number of devices they can connect to. If you have more than 6 devices (a band, earphones, etc.) connected to your phone, try disconnecting them if you cannot connect to the dice. Modern phones are usually can connect to 10-16 devices at a time.

- Allow the app to use Bluetooth and/or Location Services.

- On Android, make sure the GPS is ON. While we are not tracking you, this is somehow a must-have for Bluetooth communication, too.

- On Android, Bluetooth has some bugs. You should try restarting the phone if you have any connection problems.

- You don’t have to connect to the dice from your Bluetooth Settings, the app will set up the connection.

After successfully installing the app. If you have 19mm dice, then make sure your app is at least version 1.3.32, otherwise, the app will recognize your dice as white, and you have to manually set the colors by tapping on every die in the app. The app should offer the upgrade to the latest app version, but you can always go to the User Guide, Version History, and tap the “Check for updates” button.

When you have the latest app, just go to Settings, and click on the “List devices” button next to the “Connect BT dice” label. Shake your dice, turn them 90 degrees, and slowly they will appear in the list. Tap each of them, and the app will connect to them. After you finished, click on the OK button to close the modal. The images of your dice with their actual value should be visible now. Tapping on a die will open the information screen of the die with the name, color, and battery level. You can change the color or rename your die if you want. We recommend turning on auto-connect, so the app will immediately connect when started.

If a die does not appear in the list, make sure:

- it is charged properly,

- it was shaken hard,

- it is not connected to another app or another phone,

- it is not the normal die, but a Spotted Dice die.

If it is still not connected, you can try pressing the “Reset devices” button, turning your Bluetooth off and on, and also restart your phone. Just quitting an app won’t stop it from running, make sure you “kill” it with a gesture.

You can now tap on the Play icon at the bottom of the app, and start with the basic routine that displays the dice values, and shows if a die is moving.
