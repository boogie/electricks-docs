# NFC/RFID

## Introduction

We are producing several products using the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology popular in payment and access control (entry) systems. Magicians can use this technology to sense objects that have these kinds of chips inside. As these chips are affordable, we are able to offer a deck of cards with all the cards chipped.

Our playing cards for mentalists are the perfect tool for taking your magic performances to the next level. They were designed to look and feel like normal plastic playing cards, but each card contains an ISO14443A or ISO15693 chip inside.

We offer a variety of card options, including poker cards, flashcards, and blank face cards, with more options coming soon.

Upgrade your magic performances with our high-quality NFC/RFID products today.
