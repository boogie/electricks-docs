# Q-Type

*Q-Type* transforms your Quantum into a Bluetooth keyboard, letting you peek at the entered numbers and operands on a phone, without touching it. You can enter values into your notes app, even on the spectatorâ€™s phone, or into your favorite magic apps.

ðŸ’¡Â Note: This works by sending the key presses from Quantum over Bluetooth. Make sure your device is paired and the app you use supports external keyboards.
