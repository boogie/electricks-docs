# Q-Force: Forcing Made Effortless

Q-Force is Quantum’s built-in number forcing tool, turning your calculator into a powerful prediction device.

By default, Quantum launches Q-Force automatically when turned on . You can configure its behavior in the PeekSmith app’s Settings .

### How It Works

When Q-Force is active, pressing the equals (=) key reveals a predefined force number instead of the actual result of the calculation.

This lets you perform classic forces with ease – modernized and seamlessly built into your electronic calculator.

Your force number can be anything : a birth year, today’s date, a phone number, or a lucky digit.

### Setting a Force Number

Permanent Force Number

You can configure a default force number in Quantum’s Settings .

- If set to , no force is applied.
- If set to any other number, that value will be used each time Q-Force starts.

Temporary Force Number (On-the-Fly)

Need to set a force number in the moment?

- Enter the number on the calculator.

- Long-press the close parenthesis key ) to store it temporarily.

This number won’t be saved permanently but remains active as long as Q-Force is running.

### Force Conditions (Range)

You can define a minimum and maximum result range.

Quantum will only apply the force if the real result falls within this range .

For example:

- Expected sum of four 4-digit numbers:

Minimum: 1111 + 1111 + 1111 + 1111 = 4444

- Maximum: 9999 + 9999 + 9999 + 9999 = 39,996

This helps mask the force –  you can first demonstrate normal calculations before revealing the prediction.

### Peeking the Forced Result

Enable PeekSmith Peek to send Quantum’s display to your PeekSmith or Bond device.

You’ll see the forced number exactly when your audience does – without looking at the calculator.

### Toggle Force Mode with a Button

Turn on PeekSmith Toggle Force in the settings. You can now enable or disable the force using any button on your PeekSmith or Bond device.

### Slide Sets Force

It allows you to set the force on the Quantum.

- UP:  Force Mode Off
- 5/4 : Lets you to use  PeekSmith Toggle Force  Also you can use the opening brace “(” by press and holding to set a force number or turn on/off the Force Mode. The closing brace “)” by press and holding lets you to enter a new forced number.
