# Q-Sequence: Trigger Actions from a Calculation

Q-Sequence is a powerful mini-app that lets you assign custom actions to numbers entered as part of a single calculation .

Think of it as a programmable routine: each number in your 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 =style input can trigger a different magical effect.

This turns Quantum into a multi-phase, multi-device controller , all from one natural-looking calculation.

### What It Does

In Q-Sequence, you perform a calculation like:

1234 + 88 + 3434 + 16 =

Each number (up to 8) is captured in order , and triggers a corresponding action you’ve assigned in the settings.

For example:

- 1st number → Set time on an SB Watch (e.g., 12:34)

- 2nd number → Generate and send a Magic Square

- 3rd number → Display a Pi digit-based revelation

- 4th number → Set a force number

- …

The calculation and input look completely normal to your audience – but behind the scenes, each number is silently activating a secret.

### Configuring the Sequence

You can assign actions to each number in the sequence in the PeekSmith app → Quantum Settings → Sequence section.
