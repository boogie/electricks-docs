# Calculator

### Calculator screen

The Calculator screen in the PeekSmith app mirrors your Quantum device. It shows the same layout, buttons, and display – giving you an instant way to practice or even use it as a peek tool during performance (although a peek device like PeekSmith 3, Bond, or the PeekSmith app’s Monitor screen is better for this purpose).

### What you can do

- Practice routines: Use the on-screen calculator just like the real Quantum. All buttons work and are linked to your device.
- Assistant control: An assistant can enter or modify numbers directly on the screen – changes are reflected on your Quantum.
- Mini-app awareness: The screen displays which mini-app is currently running.
- Force settings: It also shows the active force value and whether force mode is ON or OFF.
