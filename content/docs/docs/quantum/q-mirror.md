# Q-Mirror

Q-Mirror allows two Quantum devices to connect and mirror one another’s screens. This means that whatever is typed on one calculator can be secretly viewed on the other. Whether used for a two-person telepathy act or as a covert peek tool in solo routines, Q-Mirror opens up endless possibilities for synchronized performances and hidden revelations – wirelessly and instantly.
