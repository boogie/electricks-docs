# Q-Fate: The Illusion of Choice

Q-Fate is a beautifully deceptive mini-app that transforms Quantum into a tool of mathematical inevitability. In this routine, the spectator freely selects a secret number and follows a series of simple steps guided by the performer. Despite appearing random, the outcome is always the same – a number you predicted in advance. Whether written, displayed, or revealed on another device, Q-Fate creates the powerful illusion of free will, while quietly guiding your audience to the destination you designed. It’s effortless, elegant, and impossible to backtrack.
