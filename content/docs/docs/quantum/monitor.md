# Monitor

### Monitor Screen

The Monitor screen in the PeekSmith app provides a simple way to view information sent by your connected devices and mini-apps. It works as both a status panel and a peek screen, so you can use it whether or not you own a dedicated peek device. Scroll down for videos showing how different mini-apps use the Monitor screen in real performances.

### What You Can Do

- See mini-app outputs – When Quantum (or other devices) run mini-apps, their textual information is displayed here in real time.
- Check device connections – Instantly see which devices Quantum is connected to.
- Use it as a peek screen – If you don’t have a PeekSmith device, the Monitor screen becomes your peek display. If you do, it works as a secondary screen or a reliable backup.

### Why It’s Useful

- Access Quantum’s full feature set even without extra hardware.
- Keep track of connected devices in one place.
- Always have a fallback peek option.
