# Firmware Upgrade

Keeping your *Quantum* device updated ensures you get the latest features, the best performance, and improved stability. Firmware updates improve the internal software of your device – they’re not the same as app updates on your phone.

There are two ways to update:

- Using the PeekSmith app (iOS or Android)
- Using the MagiScript Editor (desktop browser with Bluetooth)

### Update with the PeekSmith App

You’ll need at least version v6.2.62 of the app. Here’s how to update:

- Update the app –  Download or update the PeekSmith app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/). Make sure you have v6.2.62 or later.
- Log in –  Make sure you’re logged in with your Apple ID or Google account .
- Go to Settings –  In the PeekSmith app, tap “Settings” > “Connect Devices” > “Quantum” .
- Connect Quantum – Tap “List Devices” , select your Quantum, and pair it if prompted. ⚠️ Important :  If your device was previously paired via system Bluetooth, unpair it first to avoid conflicts.
- Open the Details page  – Once connected, tap “Details…” .
- Start the update  – Tap the yellow “Firmware Update” button, then tap “Update” .
- Wait and don’t switch apps  – The update will run slowly, that’s expected. After reaching 100%, the screen might freeze for ~30 seconds , then show “boot” for another ~30 seconds. The app will reconnect and finalize the process.

✅ *Done!* You’re ready to explore the new features.

### Update with the MagiScript Editor

If you prefer using a desktop:

- Use a compatible browser  – Open [MagiScript Editor](https://msedit.electricks.info/) in Chrome or Edge on a Bluetooth-enabled laptop or desktop.
- Turn on your Quantum  – Make sure it’s powered on and not paired with your phone.
- Connect via browser  – Tap “Connect” in the editor, and approve the pairing prompt.
- Follow the update prompt  – A popup will appear with the update option. Click “Update” .
- Wait patiently  – Just like in the app, the process is slow. Expect the same ~30s freeze , then ~30s showing “boot” after reaching 100%.
- Reconnect in the editor  – After the update, reconnect manually in the MagiScript Editor to continue working.

✅ *Done!* Your firmware is up to date.

### Tips & Troubleshooting

⚠️ *If the update fails or freezes:*

- Restart the app and your phone (or browser and computer).
- Unpair / forget Quantum from Bluetooth settings.
- Try the update again.

💡 *Tip:* Disable Bluetooth on your phone while updating via the MagiScript Editor to avoid interference.

🪫 *Note:* Charge your Quantum before updating. A low battery can cause update failures.
