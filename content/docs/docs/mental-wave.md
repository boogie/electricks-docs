## Turning Mental Wave ON and OFF

Mental Wave is a Bluetooth Audio device, which means you can pair it with your phone (both iPhone or Android) and it works like a headphone.

It has one button in the middle of the device with several functionality:

- turn the device ON by pressing it for 3 seconds,

- turn the device OFF by pressing it for 4 seconds,

- play/pause media on the phone with a short press.

Upon its initial activation, a blue LED will flash, signifying the device is ready to pair. To establish a connection, simply access the Bluetooth function on your cell phone, search for available devices, and select â€˜BMS1001â€™.

After successful pairing, Mental Wave becomes your phoneâ€™s speaker.

Try to play a song or a video with your phone, to verify if the sound comes out of the gimmick. If not, try to pair again or turn up the phoneâ€™s volume.

Adjust the volume directly from your phone settings to find the perfect level for your listening pleasure. Ensure you discover the optimal volume setting for an enhanced experience.

You can charge the device with micro-USB.

## Basics

We recommend practicing the usage with a simple audio player. Depending on how you plan to use the device, try it on your own head at different positions, or with a partner to learn handling.

You can use it with any apps that plays audio, and you can even use portable MP3 players/voice recorders with Bluetooth Audio support. The PeekSmith app (and our others apps) are optimized to work with Mental Wave.

When you are familiar with the device, read our further advices and ideas.
