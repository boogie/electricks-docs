# Cases / Screen Protectors

## About

Bond shares its dimensions with the Google Fitbit Versa 2 and Versa Lite, meaning that many cases and screen protectors designed for those models can be used with Bond seamlessly.

While the screen protector offers good scratch resistance, please keep in mind that it may not form the tightest seal, especially in wet environments like showers. Water and dust may occasionally slip underneath, but the overall protection is effective.

## Cases

We’ve found these products to work particularly well:
