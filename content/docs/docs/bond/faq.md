# FAQ

## What Is the Retail Price of Bond? How Can I Place an Order?

The price of the [Bond](https://electricks.info/?post_type=product&p=15081&) is $327. Please read our [Shipping](https://electricks.info/shipping/) page for details about VAT and customs fees. You can buy them in our Electricks Magic Shop. Please visit the Bond product page.

## What Makes Bond Unique?

Bond is designed specifically for magicians, ensuring messages stay visible on the screen. Unlike the Apple Watch or smart bands which turn off their screens to save battery, Bond keeps the display active without automatic dimming.

Bond serves as both a peeking and input device. Its touchscreen allows for easy interaction through taps and swipes. The high-resolution Retina display is sharp enough to show detailed drawings from impression pads and display large amounts of information clearly. The screen is optimized for readability, and we’re collaborating with app developers to expand what you can view at a glance.

Compact enough to be palmed or worn on the wrist, Bond is already compatible with several apps, enhancing its functionality for magicians.

## Should I Wear Bond or Hold It in My Palm?

It depends on how would you like to use it.

If you’re wearing an SB Watch or prefer discreetly peeking at information, it’s better to palm (or conceal) Bond.

For inputting information with swipes, simply move your hand behind your back and swipe – it’s more convenient to wear Bond when doing so. Wearing Bond is also ideal if you’re receiving information through vibrations.

## Is Bond a Smartwatch?

No, Bond is not a smartwatch. While its design may resemble devices like the Apple Watch, Bond is built specifically as a peeking and input device for magicians. Adding smartwatch features, such as displaying the time, is something we may explore in future firmware updates.

## Is Bond PeekSmith 4? How does it Compare to PeekSmith 3?

No, Bond is not an upgrade to PeekSmith 3 but a completely new device with different purposes. While similar in some ways, Bond is primarily an input device, while PeekSmith 3 remains a dedicated peeking tool. We recommend using them together—Bond for input, PeekSmith 3 for peeking.

Bond retains many features of PeekSmith 3, with added capabilities like touchscreen input for time, numbers, and letters. It has one physical button, but the touchscreen emulates two extra buttons for easy control. When worn on the wrist, Bond supports natural hand gestures using its accelerometer.

Unlike PeekSmith 3, Bond doesn’t operate in standalone mode or connect directly to other devices—this may come in future updates. It’s designed for compatibility with PeekSmith 3 apps, sharing a similar Bluetooth name to ensure seamless integration. Firmware updates will address any compatibility issues and bring new features, just like with PeekSmith 3.

While PeekSmith 3 has an on/off switch, Bond is always on. We’re targeting one week of standby time and several hours of active use per charge. Like PeekSmith 3, Bond includes a discreet vibration motor for signaling.

## What Are the Dimensions of the device?

The dimensions of the Bond without a strap are: 37.5 mm x 40 mm x 11 mm.

## What Kind of Battery Does Bond have?

It has a rechargeable LiPo battery.

## How Can I Charge the Device?

Place it in its charging cradle so that the charging port on the back of the device and the corresponding pins on the cradle line up. The watch should snap firmly into place using magnets embedded in the cradle. Connect the USB cord into a socket delivering 5W (1A 5V) – a USB 3.0 laptop port is an ideal power source for the Bond. The Bond should instantly display the charging status. Remove the Bond when fully charged.

## How Long does Bond Last on a Full Charge?

The exact battery life depends on your brightness settings and usage. We’re continuously working to improve it. In standby mode, with no apps connected, Bond is designed to last 8 days. With active use, it should run for several hours. Be sure to keep your firmware up to date, as we are constantly optimizing battery performance.

## Does Bond have an Audible Beeper or Speaker?

No, but in practice the vibration motor is a substitute for use with alerts, and a more discrete option for magicians.
