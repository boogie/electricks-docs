# Watch Bands / Straps

## About

Bond comes with a standard 20mm watch band/strap, ensuring compatibility with most SB Watch wristwatch straps, except for the SB Watch Steel models. You can explore a variety of options on your favorite watch accessory sites, or browse our own collection here:

- The price of the [SB Watch Strap](https://electricks.info/product/sb-watch-straps/) is $17.

- The price of the [SB Watch Steel Strap](https://electricks.info/product/sb-watch-steel-straps/) is $24.

Please note that while many 20mm bands/straps will fit, not all will work perfectly due to Bondâ€™s unique watch body design. This is especially true for Nato-style bands, which tend to be too thick for a secure fit.

For the best experience, we recommend using thin straps to ensure both comfort and functionality.
