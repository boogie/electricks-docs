# Changing the Straps

Your Bond device features [20mm quick-release straps](https://electricks.info/docs/bond/watch-bands-straps/), designed for both comfort and style. Replacing them is a simple process that allows you to customize your Bond in moments.

## What You’ll Need

Replacement 20mm quick-release straps.
We recommend using quick-release straps for the easiest installation and best fit with your Bond.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Remove the Current Strap

- Turn your Bond over to expose the back side of the strap.

- Locate the small metal lever (quick-release mechanism) on the strap.

- Slide the lever inward with your fingernail or a small tool, gently detaching the strap from the lug.

- Carefully remove the strap, ensuring no pressure is applied to the lugs.

2. Attach the Replacement Strap

- Take your new 20mm quick-release strap.
- Align one end of the strap with the lug pinhole on your Bond.
- Compress the metal lever on the strap to retract the pin, and position the strap between the lugs.
- Release the lever slowly, ensuring the pin locks securely into place.
- Repeat the process for the other half of the strap.

3. Check for Security

- Gently tug on both ends of the strap to ensure they are securely attached. The quick-release mechanism should hold the pins firmly in the lugs.

## Tips for Choosing Replacement Straps

Look for 20mm straps specifically labeled as “quick-release” for compatibility.
