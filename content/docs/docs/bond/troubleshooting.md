## Can't Connect to the Bond

If you are experiencing difficulty connecting your Bond to your phone, it may be due to a setting issue or a low battery. Even if the Bond is still ON with a low battery, it may not have enough power to maintain a Bluetooth connection. To troubleshoot this issue, you can check the following:

- Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone.

- Check that the Bond is turned on. 

- Ensure that no other devices, such as a remote or another phone, are currently connected to the Bond.

- Keep in mind that phones have a limit on the number of devices they can connect to at one time. If you have many other devices (such as a fitness band or earphones) connected to your phone, try disconnecting some of them to see if this resolves the issue. Most modern phones can connect to 10-16 devices at once.

- Try restarting your phone, or moving at least 20 meters away from other devices to see if this helps to disconnect any other devices that may be connected to your watch.

- If your phone cannot detect the Bluetooth signal from your Bond, restart it. After the Bond restarts, try connecting it to your phone again.

## For Android

- Make sure that GPS is enabled on your device. GPS may be required for Bluetooth communication to work properly.

- Allow the app to access Bluetooth and/or location services.

- Note that there may be some bugs in the Bluetooth implementation on Android devices. If you are experiencing connection issues, try restarting your phone.

- You do not need to connect to the watch from your Bluetooth settings. The app will handle the connection process.

## For iOS

- Allow the app to access Bluetooth and/or location services.

- You do not need to connect to the watch from your Bluetooth settings. The app will handle the connection process.
