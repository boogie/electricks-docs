## General Settings

Show loading screen : if you’d like to start the app showing a black screen only, then disable this option
App start page : here you can select what should happen when you start the app. You can go to the Homescreen or the Settings page, or you can select some routines to start automatically.
Freeze custom time : If you enable this option, the time on your watch will be frozen after you set a custom time. WARNING: if you exit the app, the time will unfreeze and the watch hands will continue moving! Also if you set the current time, the time will never be frozen.
Vibrate when time is set : enable this to get a vibration feedback from your phone when the time is set on the watch.
Watch connection indicator : the app can display a small dot on every screen to indicate if the watch is connected or not. You can either turn this OFF, or select the placement of the indicator.
Indicator color : when the watch is disconnected, the dot will always be RED. For the connected status here you can select some predefined colors, transparent or “custom”. If you select transparent, then you will see the RED dot when the watch is not connected, and the dot will disappear when the watch is connected.
Custom indicator color : if you selected “custom” for the indicator color, here you can select a custom color from a predefined list of colors.
Enable WEB input : you can have a helper who sets the time on your connected watch remotely, from any WEB-browser. They should open this page: [ bsmagic.app/time ](https://bsmagic.app/time) and enter your username and PIN, or – if you don’t trust them enough – then they can also login with your secret token. You will find your token under your username and PIN in the TimeSmith app (and you can generate a new token whenever you want). In the app you’ll have to enable WEB input everytime you want to use it (it will be automatically disabled when the app starts). Your helper can enter the time on the website (4 digits recommended), and send the time to your watch by clicking the green checkmark. When WEB input is enabled, the app will check the server for a new time entry every 5 seconds.
Preset custom times : you can preset multiple custom times, and use them for your routines as force times, or just simply use them for testing. The first 3 custom times will be displayed on the main routine screen (as grey buttons). You can cycle through all custom times by pressing the volume buttons (see next chapter), BT remote buttons or the button(s) on the watch, or using swipes.
Monitor volume buttons : if you enable this option, you can use the volume buttons to perform some predefined actions. Also on Fossil, Kronaby etc. watches you can assign volume up/down actions to the watch buttons in the official companion apps.
Volume UP action : select the action for the volume UP event
Volume DOWN action : select the action for the volume DOWN event
Watch button action : select the action for the watch button press event (SB Watch and TW only)
Apple Watch tap action : select the action for the Apple Watch screen tap event
Possible actions:– nothing
– set current time: set the actual time on the watch
– next preset time: set the next predefined custom time on the watch (cycle through all preset times)
– voice ON/OFF: turn voice recognition ON/OFF
– voice ON: turn voice recognition ON
– voice OFF: turn voice recognition OFF
– reset swipes: if you are on the swipe screen, you can start over the swipe input after resetting
– send to Stranger: if you have set up the Stranger app (by Jonathan Levit) to receive info from TimeSmith, you can send the last custom time using this action
– START dice routine: you can use this action to start over the Dice & Time routine
