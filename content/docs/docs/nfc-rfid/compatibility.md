# Compatibility

While developing our own NFC/RFID reader, we have designed these products to be compatible with Hugo Shelleyâ€™s Insight reader, which supports the ISO14443A standard ONLY , as well as with most mobile phones equipped with NFC/RFID readers, including the latest iPhones and Android devices.

Latest iPhone 16 and many recent smartphones have NFC readers capable of recognizing both ISO14443A and ISO15693 standards. While the ISO15693 standard provides a slightly greater range than ISO14443A, this difference is minimal and unlikely to significantly impact typical use cases.

Please note that Some major phone brands may not include NFC/RFID readers as a standard feature, so we recommend checking your device specifications to ensure compatibility before purchasing.
