## Description

The cards are poker sized (63mm x 88mm) and made from durable plastic that can withstand cleaning with warm water and blending without any damage. They are slightly thicker than normal paper cards at 0.38mm, ensuring they can withstand regular use. Our goal is to provide cards that can be used again and again, making them a valuable addition to any mentalist’s arsenal.

András is creating these cards in-house to look great and to serve your magic performances the best. The Luna back design is a moon and starry night-inspired one-way design, with amazing details, and we have worked on it with[ wildgica](https://www.facebook.com/wildgicahu). The Jokers of the poker set were designed for this moon theme, and our flashcards are having moon and magic references as well. We have worked with[ Cheellart](https://www.cheellart.com) to design the Jokers and the flash card faces.
