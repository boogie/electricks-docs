# Color Sense-action

## About the Routine

The spectator shuffles the cube, and keeps the cube in their hands. You try to sense the colors from a distance, without ever looking at the shuffled cube…. “Is there a GREEN in the center somewhere?” – you ask, and the spectator looks for the green side of the cube… you then name every color on that side.

## Method #1

Select “ Color sense-ation ” as the routine, and set the option “ Wait after mixing ” to either 3sec (when practicing) or to 10-15sec (when performing). Select any of the “ Onscreen display ” options (audio guide for this routine will be available soon). Then start the routine… Wait till the  blue progressbar  completes and “ Ready to go ” or “ GO ” appears after displaying the name of the routine.

At the beginning of the routine you can ask the spectator  what is their favourite color  of the six colors on the cube. As you give the cube to them to mix, you  secretly turn the side  that has the chosen color in the center. So if they choose  GREEN , you turn the  GREEN  side as you ask them to mix the cube (of course you can make more turns before handing them the cube). You will turn around or use a  blindfold  for the rest of the routine.

When they are ready mixing the cube, ask them to  look for  their favorite color in any of the c enter pieces , and hold that side facing them. Now you are sensing all colors from that side, naming them  one by one  successfully.

## Method #2

You don’t have to ask for their favourite color at all…. you can  select a color  yourself (eg.  YELLOW ), and  turn that side  when you are handing them the cube. Then ask them to mix the cube while you turn around. When they are ready mixing, you will try to sense the colors from one side…

“ *Is there a YELLOW somewhere in the center?* ” – you ask them, and of course they will  find the yellow center . Now you announce all colors from that side one by one… You can  repeat the routine  using a different color each time. But you can also repeat the routine using the last method:

## Method #3

When the spectator is ready mixing the cube (and the countdown has ended), the app will display the side that they turned first when mixing… but you  don’t start sensing  the colors just yet! You can  switch to another side  just by asking the spectator to  turn ANY side  (maybe their favourite color)  once more . When they turn any side, the app will display  colors from that side . They can  repeat  turning any side as many times as they want, the app will always display the side that has been turned last.

Of course you can c ombine all three methods  in a longer routine (I suggest  repeating only once  with a different method).
