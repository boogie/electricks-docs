# Our Cubes

## Why Are We Offering Three CubeSmith Cubes?

We have 3 different CubeSmith Cubes available for our CubeSmith app, each one has an advantage.

Using more and different-looking cubes can lower the suspense factor, as the variety of cubes makes it look like it is your real collection of cubes, and people would not think there are so many types of connected cubes. The CubeSmith app has routines with one and two cubes, but you can connect more, and let the spectator select a cube.

❗️Please note that Xiaomi stopped producing the cubes we use to make the Classic and Deluxe.

👍  CubeSmith Chroma : It is a Monster Go AI stickerless cube from GAN, but we are removing their logo. A stickerless cube to spice up your presentations.

❤️  CubeSmith Classic  ( *our favorite* ): It is a Xiaomi cube stickered with our stickers, with a blunt edge and a matte material. We think this is the best offer you can start with your CubeSmith career.

🌟 CubeSmith Deluxe: This is a cube that has parts from both a Xiaomi and a Giiker cube. The core is Xiaomi, and the outside pieces are Giiker. They are assembled by Vinci Tang, and also stickered, and the magnets are glued for smooth and silent turns. These cubes have rounded edges and glossy material. They are great for speedcubing and probably have the most innocent look.

You can buy and sticker/modify other compatible cubes on the market as well.
