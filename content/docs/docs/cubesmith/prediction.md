# Prediction

## About the Routine

The spectator opens a webpage showing a  blog site about cubing  (https://cubing.rocks/your-username) on their phone. You tell them some facts about the cube, which you’ve read in the blog. Then you give them the cube to mix… and the final pattern will match the image on the blog page (photo in 3rd article). It’s an unbelievable coincidence!

## Setup

First of all, you have to set up a username/PIN to be able to use the prediction effect. If you haven’t already done that, [please follow the instructions here.](https://cubesmith.info/setting-up-the-prediction)

## Steps

Select “ Prediction only ” as the routine, and set the option “Wait after mixing” to either 3sec (when practicing) or 10-15sec (when performing). Select “Fake lock screen” as your “Onscreen display”, and turn on “Turn OFF screen when covered” in “Other Settings”. Then start the routine… Wait till “ Ready to go ” or “ GO ” appears after displaying the name of the routine. Then put your phone in your pocket.

Now tell the spectator about a blog page that has articles on the Rubik’s cube.  Open the webpage on their phone , the address is  cubing.rocks/your-username  (replacing the end with  your username  you have already set up in the app). Don’t tell them about the 3rd article yet.

Then at any time, you give the cube to the spectator to mix. With each turn the timer resets, so you will have to wait X seconds after the shuffle before the prediction photo gets generated online. When the prediction is ready, you would see “OK” on the screen (but the phone is in your pocket anyway). Then you ask the spectator to check out the 3rd article on the fake blog page… and there will be a photo of a cube that has the same pattern as their shuffled cube.

You can restart the routine at any point by  turning ANY side  of the cube  4 times  in opposite directions (forward-back-forward-back). Also, you can switch routines while the name of the routine is still being displayed, you do this by turning any side of the cube forward (next routine) or backward ( previous routine ). Remember to always wait for “Ready to go” before you start the routine, so you wouldn’t accidentally switch routines!

## Saving the Photo Locally

There is an option called “Save photo to gallery” which would save the prediction photo (generated online) to your local gallery or camera roll. However, I strongly advise  NOT TO  show your phone to the spectator, because as soon as they see your phone,  they will suspect a connection  with the cube.

## Using a Personalized Prediction Photo

I offer an option to use customized photos (where  you are holding the cube ) as blog images, but this will cost extra money. Retail price for a custom photo will be  $35 .

I’ll need a high-resolution photo of you holding the cube, in a way that 3 sides are clearly visible, and the cube has no shadows and reflections on it. The default prediction photo will be then replaced by your custom photo and  will change automatically every time you perform the prediction routine.
