# Corner Cutting

## About the Technique

Corner cutting is a technique used when solving puzzles to make turns before completing a previous turn. This allows for smoother, faster solving and can improve accuracy in turning. The amount a puzzle is able to cut is heavily linked to the tension, with tighter tensions allowing for less cutting and looser tensions allowing for more cutting.

All the cubes we are selling have very good corner cutting capabilities, like every modern cube from the last 5+ years. That said, our CubeSmith Pro cubes are optimized the most for these kinds of quick-solving techniques.

In terms of how much it matters, if you have an accurate turning style, you may see a marginal improvement with puzzles with higher levels of corner cutting. However, for those with rough turning, puzzles with better corner cutting can make up for this lack of accuracy in turning.

## Learn this Technique

Step 1: Understand the basics

Before you begin, it’s important to understand the basics of corner cutting. We recommend watching the video below. As we explained above, corner cutting is a technique used in solving puzzles where a turn on a puzzle is not fully completed before another turn is made on the puzzle. There is also reverse corner cutting, which is when the layer is turned counter-clockwise.

Step 2: Get familiar with your puzzle

Take some time to get familiar with your puzzle. Practice turning the layers and notice how they move and interact with each other. This will help you understand the mechanics of your puzzle and how it responds to different movements.

Step 3: Start with a simple move

Begin by practicing a simple move such as the “U” or upper layer 45° turn followed by an “R” or right layer 90° clockwise turn. This move is known as a standard cut and is a good place to start for beginners. This is also the algorithm that you will use to orient the cube in the CubeSmith app.

Step 4: Practice the move

Practice the move multiple times until you feel comfortable with it. Pay attention to how the layers move and how the puzzle responds to the movement.

Step 5: Gradually increase the cut

Once you are comfortable with the standard cut, gradually increase the cut by turning the layers further. For example, you can try turning the “U” layer 45° and the “R” layer 100°. As you increase the cut, you may notice that the puzzle becomes more difficult to control and may require more practice.

Step 6: Experiment with different moves

As you become more comfortable with corner cutting, experiment with different moves. You can try different layer combinations and different angles. This will help you develop a better understanding of how your puzzle responds to different movements and will also improve your overall solving speed.

Step 7: Practice, Practice, Practice

Corner cutting is a technique that requires practice to master. The more you practice, the better you will become at it. Remember to always pay attention to how your puzzle responds to different movements and adjust your technique accordingly.

## Final Thoughts

Note: It’s important to keep in mind that every puzzle may have different behavior, some may need tighter tension and some may need looser tension to corner cut effectively.

In conclusion, corner cutting is a technique that can improve solving speed and accuracy. By following this guide and practicing regularly, you can master this technique and take your solving skills to the next level.
