# Online Solver

## Introduction

Occasionally, a cube may become misaligned, causing the app to be unable to accurately determine the color positions. In such instances, it’s advisable to resolve the cube manually and reset it within the app.

## Online Help

We strongly encourage you to learn the art of solving the cube independently. However, if you’re in need of immediate assistance, online services can be a valuable resource. One such recommended site is [Rubik’s Cube™ Solver](https://rubiks-cube-solver.com/), which can calculate the steps required to solve a scrambled Rubik’s Cube from any valid starting position. Simply input your cube’s color configuration and click the “Solve” button, and then follow the provided instructions.
