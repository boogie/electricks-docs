# Cloning with a Regular Cube

## About the Routine

You introduce two cubes and give one of them to your audience to mix. Then you take the other cube (a regular one, without Bluetooth!!!), and “solve” it blindfolded so that the cube will match the other cube (the one they have mixed).

## Method

For this routine, you have to  connect only one Bluetooth cube  before you start performing. You will also need another cube that can be a  regular one  without Bluetooth. The regular cube should be either in a solved state or should match the pattern of the Bluetooth cube. Select “ Cloning with a regular cube ” from the routine list, then tap on “ Start ” at the bottom.

First, you have to hand out the Bluetooth cube to mix. You can either give it to them like it doesn’t matter which one they mix, or maybe use some kind of magicians choice (“Please select a cube for me…”). There is  one important thing  to remember: as you hand the cube over,  you have to make one turn forward  (if the regular cube is in a solved state)  or one turn backward  (if the regular cube matches the pattern of the Bluetooth cube). Then they can continue mixing the cube as they like.

When they stop mixing, the usual countdown will start. When it’s over, it will start again (using the same amount of time) so you can prepare to “solve” the regular cube. You have to  hold the regular cube  with the  WHITE side up ,  GREEN side front . As soon as the second countdown reaches zero, the cloning will start. You have to follow the cloning steps, they will automatically advance with the speed you specify in  OTHER SETTINGS . There is a new option called “ Automatic step speed ” where you can set the speed in milliseconds (1 second = 1000ms). If you are quick, you can use a value around 1000, if you’re slower then use 2-3000ms.

ATTENTION:  there will be  no correction steps , so make sure you don’t make a mistake, or the cloning will fail!!!

If the other (Bluetooth) cube  gets further mixed  while you’re solving (cloning) your cube, the app will add those extra steps at the end of the solving steps… so you will end up with a  perfectly cloned cube  every time.
