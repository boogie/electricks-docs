# Compatible Cubes

## Which Bluetooth Earpiece Do You Recommend?

The company Giiker came up with the first-ever Bluetooth cube sometime in 2018. Currently, there are many different cubes on the market, you can buy them on eBay, AliExpress, and some selected stores around the world.

While we recommend choosing [our improved cubes](https://electricks.info/docs/cubesmith/our-cubes/) (until our stock lasts), we are listing here all we are supporting with the CubeSmith app.

## Xiaomi Mijia Magic Cube (XMMF01JQD)

Xiaomi also came out with a Bluetooth cube, called the “ Xiaomi Mijia Magic Cube “. Currently, this model is our favorite of all available Bluetooth cubes, unfortunately, it seems that  Xiaomi discontinued this product . Our [CubeSmith Classic cube](https://electricks.info/product/cubesmith/) is this product with “classic-colored” stickers.

Advantages : this cube has a replaceable button battery (1632) therefore it has no charging holes, and operation time is 365 hours. It means that depending on your usage, you have to replace the battery very rarely. The cube goes to standby after 15 minutes if not connected, but stays connected forever once you use it.

Disadvantages : The body of the cube is black matte plastic, and the stickers have nice pale colors, however, they are not like the original cubes. You can re-sticker the cube if you want a more authentic look, we are selling [stickers in our shop](https://electricks.info/product/cubesmith-sticker-set/).

If you would like to get the ultimate experience, you can modify it to make it silent and look like a regular cube. Our [CubeSmith Deluxe cubes](https://electricks.info/product/cubesmith/) include all these modifications.

## Giiker

We are supporting all versions in CubeSmith, but we recommend buying the latest versions (i3S, i3SE, or i3S Light). Please note that Giiker regularly changes the Bluetooth protocol they use, so brand-new products might not work, but we are ready to catch up with them.

Advantages : most of the Giiker cubes have regular stickers, and their look is similar to the original cubes. You can easily remove the Giiker logo as it is a transparent sticker.

Disadvantages : the product has a charging hole on its sides, you should replace the stickers to hide them. You have to charge the cube regularly. 2018-2019 models tend to have an out-of-sync problem after some months of usage, but we think it has been corrected in 2021.

## GAN

The more expensive  GAN 356i  (v1, v2 and v3) has a gyroscope, so we can tell which side is facing up. The cheaper  GAN 356i Play  lacks the motion sensor, but its battery life is significantly better. The  GAN 356i Carry  and the  GAN Monster GO MG3 Ai  are powered by a button battery, so they need no charging. The cubes are really light and magnetic (easy to turn) and they don’t beep when connecting/disconnecting. However, if you play with them while not connected to the app, they lose sync and you’ll need to manually solve them (and do a RESET in the app). You can buy these currently marketed cubes [directly from GAN](https://www.gancube.com/). Please note that not all GAN cubes are connected.

Advantages : GAN makes professional cubes, one of them has a gyroscope, and some of them has a button battery. They are usually available in stickered and stickerless versions.

Disadvantages : The cubes have a higher price tag, and their center blocks are looking a little bit odd (because they are prepared for a scramble machine).

## Rubik’s Connected

The  Rubik’s Connected  has a rechargeable battery, doesn’t make weird noises when turned, and doesn’t beep when connecting or disconnecting. Always ready, no need to wake it up. It only needs re-stickering, as the white center has the Rubik’s logo, and the yellow center has the charging holes. After re-stickered, the cube can be charged after temporarily removing the plastic cover of the yellow center. The price of the cube is quite high, but I think it’s worth buying. [Click here for more info](https://particula-tech.com/shop/rubiks-connected/).

The  Rubik’s GoCube-X  has a CR-1225 button battery (no charging needed), doesn’t make weird noises when turned, doesn’t beep when connecting or disconnecting. Always ready, no need to wake it up. It only needs re-stickering, as the white center has the Rubik’s logo, and the yellow center has the charging holes. After re-stickered, the cube can be charged after temporarily removing the plastic cover of the yellow center. The price of the cube is quite high, but we think it’s worth buying.

Advantages : after re-stickering, they are a solid solution, and the Rubik’s Connected is available to purchase.

Disadvantages : the Rubik’s GoCube-X seems to be not produced anymore. The Rubik’s Connected cube has a big charging hole, you need to re-sticker. The cube is not as great for speed-cubing as others.
