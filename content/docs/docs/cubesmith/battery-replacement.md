# Battery Replacement · CubeSmith Cubes

### When Should You Replace the Batteries?

You will need to replace the battery in the CubeSmith cubes quite rarely. Depending on your usage, a battery can work for more than a year, according to the factories, they work 280-365 hours. The cube will not connect or disconnect when the battery is low.

### Buying Batteries

All the cubes we are selling have a replaceable **CR1632 button battery**. Changing the battery is quite simple, you will need a tiny screwdriver and nothing more.

**CR1632 batteries are widely available** and can be found at many retail stores and online retailers. Some places where you can purchase them include:

- Local department stores

- Electronics stores

- Drug stores

- Online retailers such as Amazon or eBay

Our experience is that big-brand batteries are not necessarily better than cheap batteries, it’s OK to buy the cheapest.

### Replacing the Battery

You have to slightly disassembly the cube. It may look scary, but not a difficult process. Make sure you watch some videos about it, and that you are doing it on a table. You don’t have to worry if a cube falls apart, you will be able to build it together again. The process is the same, but we have a video for every of our cube.
