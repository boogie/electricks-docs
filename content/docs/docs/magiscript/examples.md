# Examples

### Example Mini-Apps

This page showcases a growing collection of example mini-apps – real MagiScript code used in the built-in applications on *Atom* and *Quantum* .

Each example is a practical starting point. You can open them in the MagiScript Editor , explore how they work, adapt them to your own routines, or use them as templates for brand-new ideas.

From blinking an LED to advanced effects like time setting, number forcing, magic square generation, or stack training – these scripts demonstrate how MagiScript can control connected devices such as *SB Watch* , *PeekSmith* , *Teleport* , *Cosmos printer* , and more.

If you’re just starting out, feel free to copy and tweak the code. You don’t need to understand everything – you’ll pick it up as you go.

And if you need more examples, just ask in the MagiScript Facebook group. We’re happy to help!
