# MagiScript Tutorials

### Welcome to the MagiScript Tutorial Series

If you’re a magician curious about MagiScript but have never written a single line of code, you’re in the right place.

This tutorial series was created especially for magicians like you – performers who want to make their tech tools more personal, powerful, and magical, without needing to become full-time programmers. We’ll guide you step-by-step from your very first mini-app to more advanced creations.

Each tutorial builds on the previous one, using real examples you can modify and try right away. We focus on practical use, not just theory – so you’ll quickly see how MagiScript can help you control your devices, customize your reveals, and enhance your shows.

You don’t need to learn everything at once. Start small, copy examples, tweak them, and make them your own. If you get stuck, our Facebook group is full of helpful people – including us.

Let’s make tech feel like magic.
