# Configuration

### About

Atom features a persistent configuration system designed to store settings. With MagiScript, you get access to configuration:

- config.get() – query a configuration value

- config.set() – set a configuration value

Let’s see how you can use them.

### Available Configuration

### Configuration Get

The exit function stops the execution of the actually running MagiScript mini-app. When no device is connected to Atom, it will turn off after waiting for a connection.

configuration.get('keyboard.language');

### Configuration Set

The sleep function turns off Atom. If the code was not persisted, it also means it forgets the code running.

configuation.set('keyboard.language', 'de');

### Conclusion

These configuration-related functions will help you to use generic settings and implement mini-apps working similarly as the built-in mini-apps.
