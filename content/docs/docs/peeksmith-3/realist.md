## About ReaList

ReaList is an innovative magic app  by Greg Rostami that allows for seamless mentalism effectsusing the spectator’s phone .

PeekSmith can display search results from Realist (Google-Stats) via Inject. If your PeekSmith has previously received notifications from Inject, then it is already set up to work with Realist. There is no separate API or server specifically for Realist in PeekSmith – everything runs through Inject.

## Setting Up ReaList with PeekSmith

To receive Realist search results on your PeekSmith device, follow these steps:

- Ensure Inject is set up – PeekSmith reads notifications from Inject, which Realist updates.
- Verify Inject notifications – If PeekSmith has received Inject notifications before, no additional setup is required.
- Configure Inject in the PeekSmith app – If you haven’t set up Inject before, add your Inject API key or code into PeekSmith’s settings.
- Perform the search using Realist  – Since Realist sends results through Inject, they will appear on PeekSmith automatically.
