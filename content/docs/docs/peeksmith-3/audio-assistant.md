To use the Audio Assistant, you’ll need to first turn it on in the Multi-Display section of the PeekSmith app’s Settings. Once you’ve done that, you’ll see a new Audio Assistant section appear. From here, you can customize your Audio Assistant settings by selecting your preferred language, speech speed, and the number of repeats and delays for announcements. Additionally, you can choose how long the app should wait before announcing information.

To access these settings, follow these steps:

- Open the PeekSmith app and go to the Settings tab.

- In the Settings menu, navigate to the Add-On Features section.

- Toggle the Audio Assistant switch to the “on” position to enable the feature.

- A new Audio Assistant section will appear. Tap on it to access the customization options.

- From the Audio Assistant menu, you can select your preferred language, speech speed, wait time, number of repeats, and delays for announcements.

- Once you have customized the settings to your liking, you are ready to start using the feature.

Now, whenever the PeekSmith app collects new information, it will announce it to you using the Audio Assistant. You can use these customization options to fine-tune the Audio Assistant to meet your specific needs and preferences.

Here are some general tips for using the Audio Assistant:

- Make sure your earbuds or headphones are properly connected to your device before activating the Audio Assistant.

- Adjust the volume to a comfortable level before using the Audio Assistant, try to set it as low as possible.

You can test it out without purchasing the add-on – it will say something like “Testing 123” instead of the actual text.

The Audio Assistant is available in multiple languages including English, German, French, Spanish, Hebrew, and Arabic. It is likely that your preferred language is also supported. You can check the app to see which languages are currently available.

We recommend using it with our[ Vision glasses](https://electricks.info/product/vision/) or[ Mental Wave](https://electricks.info/product/mental-wave/) bone conduction devices, as they are specifically designed to work seamlessly with our apps and provide a high-quality audio experience, and you can receive the information without others noticing around you. Please refer to their documentation for tips on using it with our apps.
