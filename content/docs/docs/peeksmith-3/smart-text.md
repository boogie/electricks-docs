# Smart Text

## About

Smart Text is a feature to transform a text message content to a graphical representation. For example if you are sending the text “:)”, and the Smart Text feature is ON, then it will display a smiley, not the double colon and the bracket. Or, if you are sending the text “AH 7D”, it will display two cards, an Ace of Hearths and a Seven of Diamonds.

You can turn this feature on or off in the PeekSmith app under [PeekSmith 3 Settings](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/settings/) , or directly from the device using the PeekSmith menu . For help entering the menu and adjusting settings, check the [Standalone Mode basics](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/standalone-mode/) section.

## Cards

PeekSmith 3 can display up-to 3 cards. The text should be separated by whitespace (spaces, new lines). You can control how the cards are displayed – it can be “Text”, “Visual + Text” and “Visual”. The “Visual + Text” is displaying a card and a text if it’s one card, and displays cards when it is 2-3 cards. The “Visual” is always showing a card.

While generally we think this is a great feature, color-blind users might struggle to recognize colors, and should turn off this feature (or switch to “Text” or “Visual + Text”).

These text will be transformed:

- single-letter cards: “`A`”-”`Z`”

- single-digit numbers: “`0`”-”`9`”

- question mark: “`?`”

- poker cards: “`AH`”, “`7D`”, “`10S`”, and so on

- ESP symbols: “`circle`”, “`cross`”, “`plus`”, “`waves`”, “`square`”, “`star`”, “`triangle`”, and “`infinity`” (case insensitive, so “`circle`“, “`Circle`” and “`CIRCLE`” are all work

- colors: “`white`”, “`green`”, “`red`”, “`orange`”, “`blue`”, “`yellow`”, “`purple`”, “`brown`”, “`black`”, “`grey`”, “`pink`”, “`silver`”, “`gold`”, “`bronze`”, “`violet`” – and the “`#123456`” representation is also supported – it is case insensitive, so “`red`“, “`Red`” and “`RED`” all work

For example, sending the text “`A 7C Yellow`” will display 3 cards, an “A” single-letter card, a Seven of Clubs and a yellow card.

## Icons / Smileys

PeekSmith 3 can also recognize smileys and icons. One icon, and a maximum 10 characters of text is supported. The text is optional. They should be separated by a space.

- supported smileys: `:)`, `:-)`, `:D`, `:-D`, `^^`, `:(`, `:-(`, `:x`, `:-x`, `:|`, `:-|`

- supported icons: `:up:`, `:down:`, `:left:`, `:right:`, `:yes:`, `:ok:`, `:correct:`, `:no:`, `:incorrect:`, `:like:`, `:dislike:`, `<3`, `:heart:`, `:temp:`, `:reload:`, `:mix:`, `:shuffle:`

For example, sending “`:)`” will display a smiley, or sending “`:ok: DONE`” will display a checkmark and the text DONE.
