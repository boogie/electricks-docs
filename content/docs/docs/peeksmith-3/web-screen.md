# Web Screen

## Using the Web Screen

 
 
 
 
 The Web Screen is a feature that allows you to open the “web screen” (a specific website) on devices with a web browser, including smartwatches, phones, tablets, laptops, or computers, and peek at the information from that screen. This feature is part of the premium [Multi-Display add-on](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/multi-display/).

 
 
 
 
 ## Steps to Use the Web Screen

 
 
 
 
 The web screen can be accessed at the URL: https://bsmagic.app/webscreen/ where you can enter your user ID, and PIN code, and select the application you want to use.

To enable the web screen, first go to the settings in the PeekSmith app, scroll down to Multi-Display, and enable the web screen. Then, go to the Settings menu and tap on User Settings, and tap on your username. If you don’t have a username, you can create one by entering a unique name (no spaces or special characters allowed) and a 4-5 digit PIN number.

To use the web screen, enter your username and PIN number on the login screen, and select the PeekSmith application from the drop-down list. You can choose to save your password or not. Once logged in, you can send text and use the PeekSmith features on the web screen as you would on the PeekSmith device. To change the font size, use one finger to swipe down on the screen, but be careful not to accidentally refresh the screen.

The web screen also works with cards and the doodle recognition feature.
