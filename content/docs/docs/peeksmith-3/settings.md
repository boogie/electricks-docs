# Settings

Let’s discuss all the options in the Settings tab. The first block called “Select PeekSmith” is about pairing the device. After tapping on the “List devices” button, you will see a list of available devices. Tap on your device, and some options will appear:

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When you start your app next time, it will try to connect to the PeekSmith device it was connected to. Also, if the device goes of out the Bluetooth range (about 10m), the app will reconnect when it becomes available again.

With the “Disconnect” button, you can disconnect your device.

 
 
 
 
 ## Firmware Version

 
 
 
 
 
This shows which firmware version is currently on the app.

 
 
 
 
 ## Battery Level

 
 
 
 
 
This shows the battery level in percentage. We recommend charging your device to 100% before your performance.

 
 
 
 
 ## Brightness Level (1-7)

 
 
 
 
 

PeekSmith has 7 different brightness levels, you can set the brightness level by tapping on this line. 1 is the darkest, good for a stage in a dark theatre. 7 is the brightest, good if you are performing in a bright environment. Select the best brightness that is readable for you, but not lights up your environment.

**You can save a lot of battery if you set the brightness to a lower value. We recommend setting it to 5 or lower.**

 
 
 
 
 ## Auto Standby Mode

 
 
 
 
 

The PeekSmith device can turn off its screen for a specified duration as set in the Standby Mode. During this time, the PeekSmith consumes significantly less battery power, extending its operational life.

 
 
 
 
 ## Keep-Alive in Background

 
 
 
 
 Even when the application is running in the background, PeekSmith maintains its speed and responsiveness. Messages appear quickly with no delay, and button presses are registered instantly, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

 
 
 
 
 ## Firmware Upload: Safe Mode

 
 
 
 
 If you encounter any issues with firmware uploads, using this method will ensure a successful update.

 
 
 
 
 ## Smart Text Display

 
 
 
 
 Smart Text is a feature to transform a text message content to a graphical representation. For example if you are sending the text “:)”, and the Smart Text feature is ON, then it will display a smiley, not the double colon and the bracket. Or, if you are sending the text “AH 7D”, it will display two cards, an Ace of Hearths and a Seven of Diamonds.

You can turn the feature ON and OFF in the PeekSmith menu, see the [basics of Standalone Mode](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/standalone-mode/) about entering the menu and changing the settings.

 
 
 
 
 ## Text Wrap/Scroll

 
 
 
 
 You can customize how text is displayed on the screen with the following options:

- **Word Wrap**: Breaks lines after complete words.

- **Break Words**: Breaks words at any point.

- **Scrolling**: Scrolls text from right to left.

 
 
 
 
 ## Font Size

 
 
 
 
 

There are four text size options:

- **Automatic**: Automatically adjusts the text size based on the length of the text.

- **Small**: The smallest font size, which can be harder to read due to its smallness but fits the most characters per line.

- **Normal**: A well-readable size that fits fewer characters per line as the small option.

- **Big**: Large font size, allowing only three characters per line.

 
 
 
 
 ## Enable Vibration

 
 
 
 
 

If you have a PeekSmith Two, PeekSmith 2B and PeekSmith 3 have a vibration motor. Turning on “Enable vibration” will vibrate the device when the app sends a new message to it. If you are using the device in your pocket, using this feature you will know when you have a new message

 
 
 
 
 ## Display Temperature

 
 
 
 
 When enabled, you can view the temperature of your PeekSmith device upon entering the home screen.

 
 
 
 
 ## Rotate Display Upside Down

 
 
 
 
 The display can rotate 180 degrees, allowing you to read the text upside down. This feature is perfect for using [SuperPeek](https://electricks.info/product/superpeek-sharpie/) on the other hand, providing an optimal solution for such use cases.

 
 
 
 
 ## Mirror Display

 
 
 
 
 The text is only readable when viewed in a mirror. Without a mirror, it is unreadable. The [PeekBox 3](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/peek-box-3/) includes a built-in small mirror, making it an ideal combination for this feature.

 
 
 
 
 ## Magnet Action

 
 
 
 
 The device features a magnet sensor that can have actions assigned to it. It works only with very close and strong magnets.

 
 
 
 
 ## Motion Detection

 
 
 
 
 You can assign actions for the following triggers:

- **Tap**: When you touch the PeekSmith.

- **Movement**: When you move the PeekSmith.

 
 
 
 
 ## Buttons

 
 
 
 
 

You can assign actions for the following buttons:

- **Side button**: short or long press

- **Left button**: short or long press

- **Right button**: short or long press
