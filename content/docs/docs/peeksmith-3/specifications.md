## Hardware

PeekSmith 3 is a Bluetooth display designed specifically for magicians. It functions like a tiny teleprompter, allowing users to peek at messages and other information during performances. Unlike Apple Watch or other smart devices, PeekSmith’s screen stays on indefinitely, making it ideal to read it when you need it. It is also compatible with various apps and can be easily hidden in small spaces like a card box or pocket. PeekSmith’s screen is optimized for readability, and we are working with app developers to maximize the information displayed on the screen. With its compact size and reliable display, PeekSmith is the perfect tool for modern magicians.
