# Voice Recorder

## About

 
 
 
 
 The **Voice Recorder** is a premium add-on of the PeekSmith app and enables you to record audio messages on your phone, and to replay them at any time through any audio output ([Mental Wave bone conduction device](https://electricks.info/product/mental-wave/),[ Vision glasses](https://electricks.info/product/vision/), phone speaker, connected Bluetooth speaker, earpiece, etc). There are several options to trigger playing the recorded sounds.

This is a multi-purpose add-on. With Mental Wave, you can use it to play instructions to a spectator, see[ documentation for routine ideas](https://electricks.info/docs/mental-wave/). Also you can play sound effects (think about the sound of shaking a bottle with a coin) during your performance. Or you can also trigger playing background music for your show.

**This is a premium add-on sold separately by Benke Smith, available for individual purchase.

 ## Using the Voice Recorder

 
 
 
 
 
In the PeekSmith app, go to Settings. Go to Add-On Features, and scroll to Voice Recorder.

Tapping the Manage button to see a list of your recordings and to add new. On the new screen you can manage them. Do a right swipe on their name, to see a stop and play button, and do a left swipe to reach the delete button. Give them a name by tapping on them. And with the Record new button, you can add another recording.

Your recordings will be saved to the cloud as a backup.

 
 
 
 
 ## Playing Back the Recordings

 
 
 
 
 

In Settings, you can setup the wait before the playing, and repeats.

In general, there are two ways now to play the recordings: on the Play screen there is a new “Play Audio” button which opens a panel to play the items with a tap.

The other way is via actions. At the Settings screen, there is an Action Control section, you can assign “play audio recording” to[ SBMote](https://electricks.info/docs/sbmote/),[ Atom](https://electricks.info/product/atom-remote/),[ PeekSmith 3](https://electricks.info/product/peeksmith-3/) /[ SuperPeek](https://electricks.info/product/superpeek-sharpie/) button presses (make sure that these devices are connected), volume up/down settings and some other ways of input.
