# Glyphs

 
 
 
 
 You can now send any text** (like from Inject, WikiTest etc, so not only recognized text from the doodle) **to Glyphs**, **without using the WEB API**.  You’ll need to have the Multi-Display add-on as usual.This method doesn’t require internet conection, if you only send a text from the app. However, if you use text recognition or Inject/WikiTest polling, then you’ll still need internet connection. If you use this method, then disable the WEB API settings that you previously used for the PeekSmith integration, you won’t need it anymore.
