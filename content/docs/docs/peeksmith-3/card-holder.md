The Card Holder offers multiple carrying options, allowing you to hold it in your hand, place it inside a card box, or slip it into your pocket. When discreetly positioned on a table within a poker card box, it remains inconspicuous, making it unlikely for anyone to suspect its true purpose as a display. Even when tucked away in your pocket, it enables you to discreetly access information by simply looking down, even when blindfolded, giving you a strategic advantage in various gaming scenarios.
