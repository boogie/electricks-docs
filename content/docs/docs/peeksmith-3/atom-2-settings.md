 ## Firmware Version

 
 
 
 
 Displays the firmware version currently installed on your Atom 2. Knowing the version helps you determine if a firmware update is needed.

 
 
 
 
 ## Battery Level

 
 
 
 
 Shows the current battery level as a percentage. We recommend fully charging your device (100%) before performances for the most reliable operation.

 
 
 
 
 ## Keep-Alive in Background

 
 
 
 
 This option ensures Atom 2 stays responsive even when the PeekSmith app is running in the background. Messages display instantly, and button presses are recognized without delay—ideal for smooth performance flow.

 
 
 
 
 ## Short Click Actions

 
 
 
 
 You can assign a custom action to each of the 12 buttons for a **short press**. This allows you to tailor Atom 2 to your specific routine or use case.

 
 
 
 
 ## Long Click Actions

 
 
 
 
 Similarly, you can assign a different action to each of the 12 buttons for a **long press – **unlocking even more control from a single device.

 
 
 
 
 ## Advanced Settings
