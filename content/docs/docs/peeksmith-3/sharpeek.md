# Sharpeek

## A Hidden Power in Plain Sight

Sharpeek , created by Pascal Vertanessian is a premium accessory crafted exclusively for PeekSmith 3 . Disguised as a standard Sharpie M15 marker, it writes like a normal pen ‚Äì yet inside, it conceals one of the most powerful peek devices ever made.

This tool is designed for magicians who value naturalness, elegance, and invisible technology . With Sharpeek, you gain a practical, discreet way to perform peeks ‚Äì no extra moves, no suspicion, no compromise.

## Why Sharpeek Makes a Difference

It‚Äôs an invisible utility device that changes the way your PeekSmith 3 blends into your act. Without it, you‚Äôre hiding a tech device. With it, you‚Äôre holding a Sharpie.

No weird moves. No extra justification. No heat.

Sharpeek allows you to:

- Perform completely natural peeks
- Write on billets or notecards as part of your act
- Keep your hands and pockets free of suspicious objects
- Upgrade your professionalism with real-world camouflage

## Installing Your PeekSmith 3

Setting up Sharpeek takes only seconds:

- Turn on your PeekSmith 3 .
- Slide it into the Sharpeek with:the screen facing you
- the side button facing the clip (this button will no longer be accessible once inserted)

- In the PeekSmith app , go to your connected device‚Äôs Details‚Ä¶ page.
- If you‚Äôre right-handed, enable ‚ÄúRotate display upside down‚Äù to ensure correct screen orientation.

The PeekSmith fits naturally into its custom slot ‚Äî snug, secure, and ready to perform.

## Using Sharpeek in Performance

When you‚Äôre holding the Sharpeek marker, you‚Äôre just holding a pen. But when the timing is right, a natural rotation in your palm allows you to:

- Effortlessly peek the screen
- Hide it completely when not in use
- Stay natural and relaxed throughout your routine

Because it looks like an ordinary Sharpie, no one thinks twice about it. And because it works like one, your handling always feels justified.

## Removing the PeekSmith

To remove the PeekSmith 3 from the marker:

- Hold the Sharpeek upright and give it a light tap into your open palm
- The device will gently slide out and can be removed easily

There‚Äôs no shaking, no force, and no stress. Just smooth handling from start to finish.

## Mini FAQ

Q: Will my PeekSmith 3 fit?
Absolutely ‚Äî Sharpeek is fully compatible with all PeekSmith 3 versions (including all the colors).

Q: I‚Äôm left/right handed, will it work? Sure. You can set the screen upside-down, read the ‚ÄúInstalling Your PeekSmith 3‚Äù section above.

Q: Can I still write with it?
Yes. It retains a shortened but functional ink tip so it writes like a real Sharpie. (Note: it may run out of ink sooner.)

Q: What about the buttons?
The side button is covered once inserted, but both front buttons remain accessible for use during performances.

Q: Is it easy to insert and remove the device?
Very easy. Just follow the steps above ‚Äî insertion is smooth, and removal takes only a light tap.

Q: Does it feel like a real Sharpie?
Yes ‚Äì and that‚Äôs the point. While the interior is custom 3D-printed, the exterior is disguised with professional-grade stickering and real parts, making it indistinguishable in the hand.

Q: Why should I use Sharpeek instead of just holding my PeekSmith?
Because suspicion kills magic. With Sharpeek, your device is hidden in plain sight, and your peek becomes completely invisible. No one will ever question why you‚Äôre holding a marker ‚Äî but they will remember the impossible revelation.
