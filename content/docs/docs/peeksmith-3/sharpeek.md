# Sharpeek

## A Hidden Power in Plain Sight

Sharpeek , created by Pascal Vertanessian is a premium accessory crafted exclusively for PeekSmith 3 . Disguised as a standard Sharpie M15 marker, it writes like a normal pen – yet inside, it conceals one of the most powerful peek devices ever made.

This tool is designed for magicians who value naturalness, elegance, and invisible technology . With Sharpeek, you gain a practical, discreet way to perform peeks – no extra moves, no suspicion, no compromise.

## Why Sharpeek Makes a Difference

It’s an invisible utility device that changes the way your PeekSmith 3 blends into your act. Without it, you’re hiding a tech device. With it, you’re holding a Sharpie.

No weird moves. No extra justification. No heat.

Sharpeek allows you to:

- Perform completely natural peeks
- Write on billets or notecards as part of your act
- Keep your hands and pockets free of suspicious objects
- Upgrade your professionalism with real-world camouflage

## Installing Your PeekSmith 3

Setting up Sharpeek takes only seconds:

- Turn on your PeekSmith 3 .
- Slide it into the Sharpeek with:the screen facing you
- the side button facing the clip (this button will no longer be accessible once inserted)

- In the PeekSmith app , go to your connected device’s Details… page.
- If you’re right-handed, enable “Rotate display upside down” to ensure correct screen orientation.

The PeekSmith fits naturally into its custom slot — snug, secure, and ready to perform.

## Using Sharpeek in Performance

When you’re holding the Sharpeek marker, you’re just holding a pen. But when the timing is right, a natural rotation in your palm allows you to:

- Effortlessly peek the screen
- Hide it completely when not in use
- Stay natural and relaxed throughout your routine

Because it looks like an ordinary Sharpie, no one thinks twice about it. And because it works like one, your handling always feels justified.

## Removing the PeekSmith

To remove the PeekSmith 3 from the marker:

- Hold the Sharpeek upright and give it a light tap into your open palm
- The device will gently slide out and can be removed easily

There’s no shaking, no force, and no stress. Just smooth handling from start to finish.

## Mini FAQ

Q: Will my PeekSmith 3 fit?
Absolutely — Sharpeek is fully compatible with all PeekSmith 3 versions (including all the colors).

Q: I’m left/right handed, will it work? Sure. You can set the screen upside-down, read the “Installing Your PeekSmith 3” section above.

Q: Can I still write with it?
Yes. It retains a shortened but functional ink tip so it writes like a real Sharpie. (Note: it may run out of ink sooner.)

Q: What about the buttons?
The side button is covered once inserted, but both front buttons remain accessible for use during performances.

Q: Is it easy to insert and remove the device?
Very easy. Just follow the steps above — insertion is smooth, and removal takes only a light tap.

Q: Does it feel like a real Sharpie?
Yes – and that’s the point. While the interior is custom 3D-printed, the exterior is disguised with professional-grade stickering and real parts, making it indistinguishable in the hand.

Q: Why should I use Sharpeek instead of just holding my PeekSmith?
Because suspicion kills magic. With Sharpeek, your device is hidden in plain sight, and your peek becomes completely invisible. No one will ever question why you’re holding a marker — but they will remember the impossible revelation.

## Wick Replacement Guide

Please read carefully before starting.

🔍 Overview

This guide shows you how to extend the life of your Sharpeek by replacing the wick yourself.

💡 Tips to Extend Wick Life

- Use Sharpeek only when necessary during your routine
- Reseal the cap tightly after each use to reduce evaporation
- If the tip dries out, revive it with a drop of isopropyl alcohol
(This trick works with most permanent markers.)

⚠️ Before You Begin

Replacing the wick involves ink, and ink stains. Prepare your workspace:

- Wear gloves and old clothes
- Use absorbent paper to protect surfaces
- Work slowly and carefully — sharp or forceful movements can damage the marker

✅ What You’ll Need

- Your Sharpeek
- A new Sharpie M15
- A sharp utility knife
- A ruler
- A small piece of tape
- Absorbent paper or tissue

🔄 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Remove the old wick from your Sharpeek
   - Hold the front and the body of the marker firmly
   - Gently pull the wick while rotating it slightly
   - Do not twist or squeeze forcefully

2. Remove the new wick from the Sharpie M15
   - Use the same pull-and-rotate method
   - Handle with care to avoid ink splatter

3. Cut the new wick
   - Measure 4 cm with the ruler
   - Cut the wick straight across using a sharp utility knife
   - Place absorbent paper under the wick while cutting to catch any ink leaks

4. Prepare the wick for insertion
   - Wrap a small piece of tape around one end of the wick (This prevents ink from leaking into the marker body.)
   - Insert the taped end first into the Sharpeek
   - Slide it in gently until only the taped section is visible

5. Close the marker
   - Reattach the tip to the Sharpeek body
   - Press until you feel or hear a soft click – this confirms a proper fit

✅ You’re Done

Your Sharpeek is now refilled and ready to use again.
