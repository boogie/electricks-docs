# Multi-Display

## About

 
 
 
 
 You can buy the features separately

 
 
 
 
 The Multi-Display feature (premium add-on) allows users of the PeekSmith app to display text on a variety of third-party devices, including audio assistants, smartwatches, web browsers, and connected phones and tablets. With Multi-Display, users can enjoy many of the benefits of the PeekSmith app even if they do not have a PeekSmith device.

We recommend using Multi-Display for our [Vision One Glasses](https://electricks.info/product/vision/) or for the [Glyphs System](https://electricks.info/product/glyphs/).

### Features

The features of the Multi-Display add-on are as follows:

- 

**[Audio Assistant](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/audio-assistant/)** (Text-to-Speech): allows users to have the text from the PeekSmith app read aloud by an audio assistant.

**[Local Notifications](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/local-notifications/):** this allows users to receive notifications on any smartwatch or smart band.
