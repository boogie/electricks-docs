# WEB-doodle Feature

## About

 
 
 
 
 The **WEB-doodle** add-on is premium add-on of the PeekSmith app, it offers an online drawing app, can be loaded on the spectator’s phone.

**PeekSmith device owners** can use the black/white version of the WEB-doodle for FREE (the device must be connected to the app), and purchase the full version for reduced price (only from the PeekSmith app).

**This is a premium add-on sold separately by Benke Smith, available for individual purchase.**https://bsmagic.app/payment/?item=webdoodle

 
 
 
 
 ## Features

 
 
 
 
 With the WEB-doodle feature activated, you can **display drawings from the spectator’s phone**, on your PeekSmith display (white on black at the moment), and also on your phone’s screen (colors enabled).

The app can also **recognize handwriting** on the doodle screen, and **display the text** on your PeekSmith.

With the latest update, you can also **peek the color** selected by the spectator in the WEB-doodle: the same color will be selected on your PeekSmith app Doodle screen, and the color is also displayed on your PeekSmith device. If you have the [External Displays](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/add-on-activation/external-displays/) add-on, the selected color is also displayed on external screens (like the Apple Watch, WearOS watches, WEB-screen, BT Screen, or notifications on any smartwatch/smartband. If you have the [Audio Assistant](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/audio-assistant/) add-on, you can also hear the selected color in your BT earpiece.

 
 
 
 
 ## Basic Method (Username in URL)

 
 
 
 
 After the PeekSmith device is connected to the app, go to **USER SETTINGS** and check your username (and PIN). If you haven’t set one up yet, then choose any username and PIN (it will be OK unless the username is already taken). You will need to enter your username in the URL later.

In the app go to **DOODLE DRAWING** settings, and turn on “**Enable WEB-doodle**“. Then go to the home page and press “**START ROUTINE**“, then press the “**WEB-doodle**” button. The doodle screen will start… and you can start performing the routine.

Open the following URL on the spectator’s phone (enter your own username at the end):

[webart.ink/username](https://webart.ink/)

The spectator then can draw or write anything on the doodle screen, and you will see their drawing on your phone’s screen and also on your PeekSmith. The drawings will update every 5 seconds. When the routine is over, you should exit the doodle screen by long pressing the RED color selector, and then tap the WEB-doodle button again to stop it.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ## The Color Sequence Method (No Username in URL)

 
 
 
 
 After the PeekSmith device is connected to the app, go to **DOODLE DRAWING** settings, and turn on “**Enable WEB-doodle**“. Then tap the “Set now” button near “WEB-doodle color sequence”. The doodle screen will start… You’ll have to tap any five colors quickly (max. 1 second pause between colors), and also remember the order of the five colors. The sequence can be like:

– red, green, green, yellow, blue
– green, green, yellow, yellow, red
– red, green, red, green, pink

…and so on. If the color sequence is already reserved by another user, the app will display a warning, and you’ll have to enter a new sequence of colors. If it’s OK, the doodle screen will close and the app will display a confirmation message.

Now that you have your own color sequence, you can go to the home page and press “**START ROUTINE**“, then press the “**WEB-doodle**” button. The doodle screen will start… and you can start performing the routine. You can ask the spectator to open the following URL on their phone (no username needed at all):

[webart.ink](https://webart.ink/)

Then they can draw or write anything on the doodle screen, and you will see the drawings on your phone’s screen and also on your PeekSmith. The drawings will update every 5 seconds. When the routine is over, you should exit the doodle screen by long pressing the RED color selector, and then tap the WEB-doodle button again to stop it.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Text Recognition

 
 
 
 
 

If you’d like to display the recognized text (or hear it using the Audio Assistant via text-to-speech), you should go to **DOODLE DRAWING** settings, and set “**Recognize when idle**” to **8 or more seconds** (maybe even 10-15)… so the recognition will start when the spectator has finished drawing, and there are no more updates to the screen.

You will see the recognized text **on your PeekSmith**:
