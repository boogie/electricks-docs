# Insight / Insight Pro · Standalone Mode

## Overview

This documentation will provide you with the necessary information on how to use PeekSmith 3 with Insight Pro and its compatible features.

## Insight by Hugo Shelley

Insight Pro is an NFC (Near Field Communication) reader system developed by Hugo Shelley. It consists of a miniature wrist-worn reader and a deck of 52 electronic playing cards. With the ability to detect playing cards at a distance of up to 11cm (4.5 inches), Insight Pro offers advanced capabilities for card tricks and magic performances. The original Insight device can read one card, while the Pro edition can read up to three cards at a time. Please note that Insight is a discontinued product.

PeekSmith 3 has included support for Insight (both the original and the Pro edition) since the first firmware update. This means that PeekSmith 3 can connect to Insight devices and display the names of the scanned cards. Also, the PeekSmith app can connect to it, and read the card information.

## Connecting PeekSmith 3 to Insight

To connect PeekSmith 3 to Insight, follow these steps:

-

 

-

Long press the right button on your PeekSmith 3 device for 3 seconds.

-

PeekSmith 3 will start scanning and connecting to other Bluetooth devices in range.

-

Ensure that the Insight device you want to connect to is not already connected to an application.

-

Once PeekSmith 3 successfully connects to Insight, it will display the name of the scanned card on its screen.

It is important to note that you do not need the Insight Pro app for the standalone support of Insight with PeekSmith 3.

## Supported Card Types

PeekSmith 3 supports both Poker and ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) cards when connected to Insight. With firmware version 1.1.44 and later, you can view the latest readings for all three cards that Insight devices can read at a time. Also, the latest PeekSmith 3 firmware can read other types of cards (letters, numbers and colors).

## Programming NFC Cards for Insight

If you wish to program NFC cards to be compatible with Insight, you have two options:

-

-

Original Insight App: You can use the original Insight app developed by Hugo Shelley to program NFC cards for Insight. You can use it to program poker and ESP cards.

-

Experimental Version of PeekSmith App: PeekSmith provides an experimental version of its app that allows you to program NFC cards for Insight, including both Poker cards and ESP symbols, letters, numbers, and colors. To access the experimental version, open the PeekSmith app, and go to the “User Guide and Version History” section. Press the “Switch to Experimental” button. If you wish to switch back to the “official” version of the PeekSmith app, follow these steps: go to “User Guide and Version History” section in the PeekSmith app, then press the “Restore Official Version” button. The app will load the App Store version, and you should perform another update to ensure you have the latest version.

## Conclusion

With PeekSmith 3’s standalone support for Insight Pro, you can enhance your card magic performances by utilizing the advanced features of the Insight NFC reader. By following the instructions provided in this documentation, you can easily connect PeekSmith 3 to Insight and access its various capabilities.
