## Why

Because we’re all about solving problems and pioneering new paths for magicians. We realized that amidst our electronic marvels, there were countless untapped ideas waiting to see the light of day. And we wanted to bring them to life.

But it wasn’t just about innovation. It was about practicality too. We discovered that our electronic projects could enhance the magic of traditional card routines, like our scale project, offering a fresh twist on classic tricks.

And now, as we venture beyond our electronic roots, we’re excited to expand our product range and collaborate with magicians everywhere. Because at the end of the day, it’s about pushing boundaries and making magic accessible to all.
