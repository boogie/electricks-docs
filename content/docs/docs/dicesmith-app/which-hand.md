# Which Hand

## The Routine

Here you also have to select a master die (even if only that die is connected). After you start the routine, the app will display !!!!! and also will vibrate (if enabled) when the master die is moving. You should set the movement sensibility to the MAX value for the best results. The spectator can hide the die in one hand, and hold them out. You take their hands one by one while you move them a bitâ€¦ and the app will signal when the die moves.
