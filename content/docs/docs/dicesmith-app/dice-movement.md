# Dice Movement

## The Routine

The app will signal dice movement on the screen with a shaking animation and a yellow outline for the dice. It also displays the color of the last moved die. If vibrations are enabled, the app will vibrate the number of the position of the last rolled die (if no other die is shaken for 3 seconds). The color order is white, black, red, blue, and spotless. (If only white, red and blue are connected then blue will be 3.)
