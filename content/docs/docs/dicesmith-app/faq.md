# FAQ

## Is the App for IOS or Android?

The app is available for BOTH platforms (iOS 13 and above, Android 6 and above). Also if you buy it for one platform, you can use it on both, for no extra cost.

## Will You Support More Dice Sets in the Future?

We would like to. If we will get permission from a Bluetooth dice manufacturer, we’ll happy to add support.

## What Hardware Integrations Do You Plan?

We are open to supporting as many hardware integrations as possible. You will be able to use any of the PeekSmith models to get visual feedback (and vibration on PS Two/2B models) of the dice values. Also we will add support for the Apple Watch (iOS) and WearOS watches (Android).

## How Does PeekSmith Display the Colors and Movement?

We have several ideas in our mind, like a fixed order for the colors, or displaying the color next to the number.
