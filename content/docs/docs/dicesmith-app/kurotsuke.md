## The Routine

This is a variation of the classic “who picked the black ball” routine. First of all, you have to select a master die (which will represent the “black ball”). After you start the routine, the app will display !!!!! and also vibrate (if enabled) when the master die is moving. You can place all dice in a bag, shake them, and ask each spectator to pick a die. They should take a glimpse of the die and then place it in their pocket (so it won’t move anymore). You can tell if the master die is in the bag by shaking it, and also if you hold the bag still after they picked a die, you can tell if they picked the master die or not…
