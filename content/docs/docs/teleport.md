## Be Up-to-Date

It is important:

- for useful tips and details, read our documentation

- to get the latest features, keep updating the app and the firmware

## Turning ON and OFF Teleport

Easy first steps:

- Charge the device:  Use a wall charger, car adapter, or computer USB port. Some high-power chargers may not work, so test before relying on one. Thanks to Qi wireless charging and a long-lasting battery, you’ll rarely need to charge it.
- Battery life: A single charge supports up to 1,000 screen updates, ensuring reliable performance during long sessions.
- Turn it on: Briefly press the button on the back. The screen will change, and the device will be ready to use.
- Turn it off: Press and hold the same button until the screen starts updating. When it says “Power Off”, the device is safely turned off.
- Standby message: When turned off, the screen displays “Power Off”, but we don’t recommend turning it off. With months of standby battery life, keeping it on ensures instant readiness.

## Charging the Device

You can charge the device with the Qi wireless charger you got it with, it has a USB-A plug. You can plug your device into your computer’s USB port, or a wall charger.

It is about 1-2 hours to charge your device to 100%. You will not damage the device by keeping it on the charger for the night.

](https://electricks.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/teleport-charging.jpg)Charging options – Use the included Qi wireless charger (USB-A plug) or connect your device directly to a computer USB port or a wall charger. The marking on the back of Teleport should be aligned with the center of the Qi charger for proper charging.
- Charging indicator – While charging, Teleport’s red LED light will turn on. The light will automatically turn off once the device is fully charged.
- Charging time – It takes about 1–2 hours to fully charge the device. You can safely leave it on the charger overnight without causing damage.
- Battery care tips : Avoid complete discharge – Letting the battery fully drain can cause damage (as with any LiPo battery). Charge it at least once a month, even if not in use.
- Charger compatibility – Any 5V charger is safe to use, including high-power (100W) laptop chargers—they won’t overload the device.
