## Hardware

SB Watch is a hybrid watch that combines traditional watch design with modern technology. It is designed to be the most discreet and convincing hybrid watch on the market. The latest models have no visible branding and are designed to look like traditional watches. In contrast, many other hybrid watches have features that give away their true nature, such as branding, a crown-shaped button, text on the watch face that says “Hybrid” or “Smart”, or a 0%-100% hand. The back of these watches may also have a charging port or a CE mark that indicates that they are hybrids. By eliminating these features, the SB Watch is able to blend in seamlessly with traditional watches.
