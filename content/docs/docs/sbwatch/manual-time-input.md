# Manual Time Input

It’s very simple, as we show in the video:

**Wait for manual input**: when you use the manual input, and you haven’t typed 4 digits yet, the app will wait a few seconds before it sets the time (if you set this option to 2 seconds, and you enter “936”, the app will wait 2 seconds before it sets the time to 9:36).

**Use BT keypad**: if you use a 3rd party BT keyboard for the manual input, the app will listen for keystrokes (and the regular numeric keypad won’t be displayed). After starting the routine, make sure that the input field has the focus (blinking cursor), or else the keyboard input won’t work.
