# Standalone Mode

## About

 
 
 
 
 The standalone mode is great because it allows you to perform tricks for anyone without a Bluetooth connection spontaneously. Each of the three buttons can be assigned different actions. You will be able to configure it in the TimeSmith app. 
With this mode works excellently the “[Be the Force with You](https://electricks.info/docs/sbwatch/be-the-force-with-you/)” trick.

 
 
 
 
 ## Important

 
 
 
 
 It works only:

- when you have the **latest update (v3.0.62) **

- when the watch is **not connected** to the app or any other device

 
 
 
 
 ## Setting up the Actions

 
 
 
 
 Here’s how to set different actions for the crown and the buttons:

- Open the TimeSmith app.

- Connect to your watch.

- The connected watch will appear in the devices list. Click on the “Details” button.

- In the “Advanced Button Setup,” click the “Config” button.

- Choose your desired crown, orientation, press duration and action.

- Press the “Save Configuration” button
