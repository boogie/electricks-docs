# Using The WEB-Input

You can have **a helper** who will be able to **set the time on your connected watch remotely**, from any WEB-browser. They can be in the next room, or on another continent… using a mobile phone, a tablet or a computer. They can be a spectator of your Zoom show, and help you without other spectators noticing.

Please **check out the video** on the bottom of this page for a better understanding of how WEB input works.

To use this feature, first you have to **set up a Username and PIN** (if you haven’t done it already). In the app go to **USER SETTINGS** and tap on the field near “Username”. You can register any username (letters and numbers only, 3-10 characters) and PIN (4-5 digits, numbers only) as long as the username is not taken yet.

Your helper should **open this webpage** in any browser:  [**bsmagic.app/time**](https://bsmagic.app/time)

They can log in either using the **Username and PIN**, or your **secret token**. You will find your token under your username and PIN in the app. After the successful login they will see a number keypad, and they can **enter any custom time**. I recommend **using 4 digits** (0623 = 06:23, 1145 = 11:45 etc.) so there would be no confusion. 2 or 3 digits also could work (923 = 09:23, 66 = 06:06) but not recommended. After entering the digits, they can send the time to your connected watch by **clicking on the green checkmark**. The entered digits will turn GREEN for a second, then they can enter a new time (if they want).

To receive the custom time from the WEB, you have to c**onnect your watch**, and then **turn ON** the option “**Enable WEB input**” in **GENERAL SETTINGS**. This option will be automatically disabled when the app starts, so you have to **enable it every time** you want to use it. When WEB input is enabled, the app will **check the server** for a new time entry **every 5 seconds**. ( in the latest version of the app turn ON the option “**WEB input**” in **START ROUTINE PANEL** OR **START PANEL** in the app)

If your helper used the secret token to log in, you can **generate a new token** after the performance, ensuring that they can’t control your watch next time you enable WEB input.
