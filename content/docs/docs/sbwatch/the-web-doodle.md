# The WEB-Doodle

With the WEB-doodle feature activated, you can set the time by **drawing on the spectator’s phone**, combined with the text recognition feature.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Basic Method (Username in URL)

 
 
 
 
 Go to **USER SETTINGS** and check your username (and PIN). If you haven’t set one up yet, then choose any username and PIN (it will be OK unless the username is already taken). You will need to enter your username in the URL later.

In the app go to **DOODLE DRAWING** settings, and turn on “**Enable WEB-doodle**“. Then go to the home page and press “**START ROUTINE**“, then press the “**WEB-doodle**” button. The doodle screen will start… and you can start performing the routine.

Open the following URL on the spectator’s phone (enter your own username at the end):

**webart.ink/username**

The spectator then can draw a time on the doodle screen (like 12:36), and you will see their drawing on your phone’s screen. The drawings will update every 5 seconds. If text recognition is enabled, the drawing will be recognized, and the time will be set on your connected watch. When the routine is over, you should exit the doodle screen by long pressing the RED color selector (or the UNDO button in the top-left corner).

 
 
 
 
 ## The Color Sequence Method (No Username in URL)

 
 
 
 
 Go to **DOODLE DRAWING** settings, and turn on “**Enable WEB-doodle**“. Then tap the “Set now” button near “WEB-doodle color sequence”. The doodle screen will start… You’ll have to tap any five colors quickly (max. 1 second pause between colors), and also remember the order of the five colors. The sequence can be like:

– red, green, green, yellow, blue
– green, green, yellow, yellow, red
– red, green, red, green, pink

…and so on. If the color sequence is already reserved by another user, the app will display a warning, and you’ll have to enter a new sequence of colors. If it’s OK, the doodle screen will close and the app will display a confirmation message.

Now that you have your own color sequence, you can go to the home page and press “**START ROUTINE**“, then press the “**WEB-doodle**” button. The doodle screen will start… and you can start performing the routine. You can ask the spectator to open the following URL on their phone (no username needed at all):

**webart.ink**

Then they can draw or write any time on the doodle screen, and you will see the drawings on your phone’s screen. The drawings will update every 5 seconds. If text recognition is enabled, the drawing will be recognized, and the time will be set on your connected watch. When the routine is over, you should exit the doodle screen by long pressing the RED color selector (or the UNDO button in the top-left corner).

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ## Text Recognition Settings

 
 
 
 
 Go to **DOODLE DRAWING** settings, **enable text recognition**, set the default orientation (I recommend landscape mode, so the spactator can hold their phone rotated, and have a larger space to write the time) and then set “**Recognize when idle**” to **5 or more seconds**… so the recognition will start when the spectator has finished drawing, and there are no more updates to the screen.

Once the text (time) is recognized, it will be set on your connected watch(es).

 
 
 
 
 ## Turning OFF the Phone's Screen

 
 
 
 
 In OTHER SETTINGS you can enable “**Turn OFF screen when covered**“, so after starting the WEB-doodle screen you can turn the phone face down on the table, or put the phone in your pocket. The screen will turn OFF, but the app will still run in the foreground.
