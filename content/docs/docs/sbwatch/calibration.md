# Calibration

Calibration is the process of adjusting the hands on the SB Watch, to ensure that it is displaying the correct time. This is necessary after replacing the battery, as the watch may “forget” the position of the hands and display the wrong time. To calibrate the watch, you can use the TimeSmith app.

If your hybrid smartwatch is not displaying the correct time (every time you set a time from the app, it is going to a wrong time), it may be because the battery is low. If you find that you have to calibrate the watch frequently because it is running slow or losing time, it could be a sign that the battery needs to be replaced.

## Steps

To calibrate the SB Watch, follow these steps:

- Connect the SB Watch to the app.

- Click the green “Details” button.

- Scroll down the details page and click “Calibration START”.

- Select the watch hand you want to adjust (minute or hour).

- Adjust the position of the selected watch hand using the provided controls (<<< or >>> for large adjustments, < or > for small adjustments).

- Both watch hands should be pointing to the 12 o’clock position  (at the top) when the calibration is complete.

- Press “Save and close” to finish the calibration process.

- The watch should now be displaying the correct time.

 

You can also perform a watch hands test to verify that the hands are aligned properly.
