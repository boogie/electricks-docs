# Atom Remote

## Introduction

Atom 2 is created by Electricks . It is a groundbreaking intelligent remote for electronic mentalism. Equipped with 12 silent buttons, a vibration motor, an RGB LED, and an accelerometer, it allows users to run mini-apps created with MagiScript by the community. 
Atom 2 redefines the category with innovative features and broad app compatibility, supported by ongoing development to add many new features. 
You can use the [Atom Time](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/atom-time/) mini-app to control SB Watch without a phone, directly, or you can connect to Atom 2 from the TimeSmith app for even more features.
