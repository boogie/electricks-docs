# The Calculator Input

## The Basic Calculator Input Method

 
 
 
 
 

On the **settings** page scroll down to “**CALCULATOR**“, and open the panel.

With the first two settings, you can set which number should set the time (hour & minutes). You (or rather the spectator) can set the hour and minutes with two separate entries (like 6 and then 23), or even by entering one number (623). Everything will depend on your presentation.

#### Example #1:

**2nd number** sets the hour, **3rd number** sets the minutes.

You give your phone with the calculator to the spectator, and ask them to enter some numbers and perform some calculations, like this:

1st number: they can enter any 5 digit number, then hit multiply (x)
**2nd number**: they should think of a time, and enter the hours (they can hit = if they want)
**3rd number**: they should press + (add) and then the minutes (again, they can hit = if they want)
(the time on the watch is now being set)
4th number: they should press / (divide) and any 3 digit number… and press =

Example input: 32574 x **9** + **23** / 275 = 1066,141818181818

They tell you the result, and you guess their thought of time (9:23). As a kicker, you show them that your watch shows the exact same time.

#### Example #2:

**2nd number** sets the hour, and also **2nd number** sets the minutes.

You give your phone with the calculator to the spectator, and ask them to enter some numbers and perform some calculations, like this:

1st number: they can enter any 5 digit number, then hit multiply (x)
**2nd number**: they should think of a time, and enter the hours and minutes (they can hit = if they want)
(the time on the watch is now being set)
3rd number: they should press / (divide) and any 3 digit number… and press =

Example input: 18459 x **719** / 652 = 20355,86042944785

They tell you the result, and you guess their thought of time (7:19). As a kicker, you show them that your watch shows the exact same time.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ## The Force Number Method

 
 
 
 
 

On the **settings** page scroll down to “**CALCULATOR**“, and open the panel.

After you enable “**Force the result**“, you will see some new options. First of all you can set the number that you would like to force. If the number has decimal numbers, use a comma (like 123.456). The next option is “**Force after numbers entered**“, which means you can set when the force number should appear. If you set it to 4, then the force number will appear only after you (or the spectator) enter 4 numbers (with an operation in between), and you press the force key. And of course, there is the option to select the “**Force key**“, which can be the = (equals) or the **√** (square root) key.

#### Example #1:

**2nd number** sets the hour and also the minutes. Force number is **123.456789, **“Force after number entered” is set to **3**, force key is **=** (equals).

You place a face-down prediction on the table. Then you give your phone with the calculator to the spectator, and ask them to enter some numbers and perform some calculations, like this:

1st number: they can enter any 5 digit number, then hit multiply (x)
**2nd number**: they should think of a time, and enter the hours and minutes (they can hit = if they want)
(the time on the watch is now being set)
3rd number: they should press / (divide) and any 3 digit number… and press =

Example input: 59864 x **1125** / 133 = **123.456789**

At the end, your force number appears as the result of their calculation. You reveal your prediction, which matches the result. Then you guess their thought of time (11:25). As a kicker, you show them that your watch shows the exact same time.

#### Example #2:

**3rd number** sets the hour and also the minutes. Force number is **1234.56789, **“Force after number entered” is set to **3**, force key is **√** (square root).

You place a face down prediction on the table. Then you give your phone with the calculator to the spectator, and ask them to enter some numbers and perform some calculations, like this:

1st number: they can enter any 5 digit number, then tap x (multiply)
2nd number: they should enter any 3 digit number, then hit + (add)
**3rd number**: they should think of a time, and enter the hours and minutes… and press =
(the time on the watch is now being set)

Finally you ask them to press the **√** (square root) button.

Example input: 56412 x 128 + **542** = 7221278, and the square root is **1234.56789**

At the end your force number appears as the result of their calculation. You reveal your prediction, which matches the result. Then you guess their thought of time (5:42). As a kicker, you show them that your watch shows the exact same time.
