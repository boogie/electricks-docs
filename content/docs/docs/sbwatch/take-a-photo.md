# Take a Photo

## The Performance

 
 
 
 
 The routine is about using SBWatch to perform a trick where the performer asks a spectator to name a specific time while the watch hanging in her hand, the performer takes a photo of the spectator and the watch, and finally, the spectator checks the time on the watch and the photo, and it is the time she named.

The routine is easy to use and provides a marketing opportunity for the performer, as they can ask the spectator to post the photo on social media with the performer’s contact information.

It has several advantages:

- 

- Utilization of the phone: The performance provides a reason to use the phone, which can be integrated seamlessly into the trick.

- Ease of use: The TimeSmith app’s lock screen input method is one of the easiest ways to set the time on the SBWatch, making it easy for the performer to execute the trick.

- Marketing opportunity: The ability to send the photo of the spectator holding the watch with the correct time set to them creates an opportunity for the performer to ask the spectator to post it on social media, providing potential exposure and promotion of the performer’s services.

- Contact retention: The performer can ask the spectator to post the photo on social media with the performer’s contact information, allowing the spectator to keep the contact information of the performer.

 
 
 
 
 ## Steps

 
 
 
 
 - Imitate setting a time on the SBWatch hybrid watch in front of a spectator.

- Ask the spectator to hold the watch and face the watch towards you.

- Request the spectator to name a specific time and verbally acknowledge it.

- Pretend to “unlock the screen” and take a photo of the spectator holding the watch.

- Use the lock screen input method to enter the time named by the spectator and do the photo.

- Ask the spectator to check the watch and confirm the correct time set.

- Send the photo taken earlier to the spectator to confirm the time set on the watch.
