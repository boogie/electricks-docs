# SB Watch

[alert:danger]Are You an SB Watch 2 Owner?|Please read our dedicated [SB Watch 2 documentation](https://electricks.info/docs/sb-watch-2/).[/alert]

## Unboxing the SB Watch

Congratulations on your SB Watch!¬†This documentation covers the 2020, 2021, and 2022 editions, the Steel wristwatch, and our pocket watch models. If you own an SB Watch 2, please read our dedicated [SB Watch 2 documentation](https://electricks.info/docs/sb-watch-2/).

We hope you will like our hybrid watch ‚Äì the perfect companion for the [TimeSmith app](https://electricks.info/docs/timesmith-app/) ‚Äì and we wish you many successful performances that will amaze your audience.

And now, open the box. For wristwatch 2020, 2021 and 2022 wristwatch models, we have included a screen wipe clothe to help you keeping the watch face clean. For the Steel models you will find a tool in the package you can use to adjust the band length.

We recommend joining our [TimeSmith Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/timesmith) for updates and discussing your ideas. It is a welcoming and active community you will love. üôÇ

We have collected a lot of information on this page about charging and troubleshooting. Please read them all.

## Turning ON and Initializing the SB Watch

Please check these before setting up your watch:

- Make sure Bluetooth is ON on your phone.

- Phones have a limit on the number of devices they can connect to. If you have more than 6 devices (a band, earphones, etc.) connected to your phone, try disconnecting them if you cannot connect to the watch. Modern phones are usually can connect to 10-16 devices at a time.

- Allow the app to use Bluetooth and/or Location Services.

- On Android, make sure the GPS is ON. While we are not tracking you, this is somehow a must-have for Bluetooth communication, too.

- On Android, Bluetooth has some bugs. You should try restarting the phone if you have any connection problems.

- You don‚Äôt have to connect to the watch from your Bluetooth Settings, the app will set up the connection.

We have more troubleshooting tips on our[ Troubleshooting page](https://timesmith.info/troubleshooting).

We are shipping the SB Watch products turned on, and updated to the latest firmware. The watch might be sleeping, wake it up with pressing the crown.

Open the TimeSmith app, then go to Settings and tap on the ‚ÄúList devices‚Äù button. Now press the Black button with the watch name (something like SBWatch-112345, where the numbers are your watch identifier, starting with 1), and the app will connect to the watch. Watch hands will go a full circle, wait for it. We have calibrated your watch, but if the watch does not correctly show the time, then Tap the green ‚ÄúDetails‚Ä¶‚Äù button, scroll down the screen, and select ‚ÄúCalibration START‚Äù.

## Next Steps

Make sure you read our [TimeSmith app‚Äôs User Guide](https://timesmith.info/user-guide) and the [SB Watch FAQ](https://timesmith.info/sbwatch-faq).

About every 6-12 months you will need to replace the CR2032 button battery inside the watch ‚Äì you should check our [battery replacement guide](https://timesmith.info/battery-replacement) before taking the watch to a jeweller / watchmaker.

We are regularly releasing a new firmware (the software running on the watch) for SB Watch to fix bugs and introduce new features. Make sure your watch has the latest firmware. You can follow our [firmware update guide](https://timesmith.info/firmware-update).

To simply set the time on the watch with no phone, we recommend using [Atom remote](https://electricks.info/product/atom-remote/) or [MrCard](https://electricks.info/product/mrcard/).¬†SB Watch is also compatible with a few apps and other devices (remotes). We have collected them on the [compatible apps and devices](https://timesmith.info/compatible-apps-and-devices) page.¬†
