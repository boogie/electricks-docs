- Black screen: similar to the Doodle, but it is for peeking a drawing
- Dice: three dices individual values are sent in real time to the screen of MrCard.
- Swami: it is to enter text by drawing each letter on the screen, then the app does a text recognition, and displays it on the MrCard screen.
- Web Polling: it is for collecting information from other apps.
