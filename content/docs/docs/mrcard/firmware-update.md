How to Update the MrCard Firmware

- A menu will appear. Select App by pressing the A button, then confirm with the O button.
- Open the IARVEL App on your device and press Connection.
- Select MrCard from the list and press Connection again.                                                                                        ⚠️ If MrCard doesn’t appear in the app:

### What is Firmware? (And How It’s Different from App Updates)

Firmware is the software that runs inside your physical device — such as PeekSmith, Atom, SB Watch, or Quantum. It controls the device’s behavior: the screen, buttons, Bluetooth connection, vibration, and other hardware functions.

This is not the same as an app update.

- An app update upgrades the mobile app you use on your phone or tablet (like the PeekSmith app, Atom Remote app, or Quantum app).
- A firmware update upgrades the internal system of the physical product.

### Why Firmware Updates Matter

Firmware updates can:

- Fix bugs and glitches.
- Improve Bluetooth stability and connection reliability.
- Add new features and enhancements.
- Optimize battery life and performance.
- Improve compatibility with apps, iOS, Android, and other connected devices.

### When to Update (and When Not To)

✅ Update if:

- A new feature is released that you want to use.
- The update fixes issues that affect you.
- Support has recommended an update to solve a problem.

🚫 Avoid updating if:

- You have an important performance within a few hours.
- Everything is working perfectly for your current needs.
