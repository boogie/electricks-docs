Turn it on using the P button.

- Go to Settings and scroll to the Accessories section.

- Enable MrCard .

- At the top of the Settings page, go to Connect Devices .

- Tap “List devices” and select your MrCard from the list.

- Tap to connect. It should pair automatically.

### Setting the time with MrCard

- Open the Swipe screen in the TimeSmith app to set the time on your watch.
