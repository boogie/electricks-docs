# Send Text Screen

### What is the Send Text screen?

 
 
 
 
 The Send Text screen lets you display any text on your peek device.

- An assistant can type a word, number, or phrase in the PeekSmith app and send it directly to the magician’s device.

- A magician can use remotes (Atom, ATC, MATT+, Quantum, etc.) to enter text hands-free and forward it to a peek device, Teleport, or even other apps via the API.

This makes it a versatile tool for peeks, predictions, and seamless communication during performance.

 
 
 
 
 ### How to use Send Text

 
 
 
 
 
- Open the Send Text screen in the PeekSmith app.

- Type the text into the input field, or use a connected remote to enter it.

- Tap “Send” (or use the remote’s send method) — the text appears on your peek device.

 
 
 
 
 ### Supported input methods

 
 
 
 
 Manual input (assistant)

- Type any text directly into the on-screen field.

- Tap “Send” to transmit it instantly.

Bluetooth remotes (magician)

You can enter and send text hands-free with:

- Atom 2

- Wilson Nexus

- Thoughtcast Versa

- ATC

- MATT+

- Quantum

ATC and MATT+

- Press to enter a single number.

- A very long press sends the number.

Quantum

- Numeric buttons enter numbers.

- Other buttons enter spaces.

- Equal (=) sends the text.

💡 Example: With Quantum, you can enter multiple lotto numbers and forward them to another app – a clean and natural way to handle number predictions.
Important notes

⚠️ Bluetooth keyboard limitation
Keyboard-emulating remotes (like Nexus or Versa) only work if the Send Text screen is active and the input field is focused. This is a general limitation of mobile devices.

💡 Atom, ATC, MATT+ and Quantum advanced integration
If these remotes are paired in the PeekSmith app’s Settings, they can send numbers/text even when the screen is locked or the app is running in the background.

⌨️ Send with Enter key
There is an optional toggle to send the typed text when you press Enter – useful for Bluetooth Keyboards.

Beyond peeking: advanced uses

The text you enter isn’t just for display – it can also trigger powerful actions:

- Send to Teleport, with three different presentation styles.

- Forward to a Web API for custom integrations.

- Use with apps like Inject, Bridge, or Glyphs.

- Announce out loud with Text-to-Speech (TTS) (via the Audio Assistant add-on).
