# Colors

### What is the Colors screen?

 
 
 
 
 The Colors screen lets an assistant instantly send a color choice to the magician’s peek device.

Unlike other screens (Poker Cards, ESP Cards, Predefined Text), this feature is assistant-only: you cannot enter or select colors with remotes such as Atom, ATC, MATT+, or Quantum.

This makes it ideal for direct assistant-to-magician communication in color-based routines.

 
 
 
 
 ### How to use Colors

 
 
 
 
 - Open the Colors screen in the PeekSmith app.
- Tap the desired color button (e.g., Red, Blue, Gold).
- The selected color is displayed instantly on the magician’s peek device.

 
 
 
 
 ### Available colors

 
 
 
 
 - Red
- Blue
- Black
- White
- Green
- Yellow
- Orange
- Purple
- Brown
- Grey
- Pink
- Silver
- Gold
- Bronze
- Violet

 
 
 
 
 ### Supported devices

 
 
 
 
 The Colors screen works with:

- PeekSmith 3 / SuperPeek
- Bond
- MrCard (via the PeekSmith app, with rotation support)
- Teleport (can display colors, including in image-based reveals, but mostly limited to display them as text)

 
 
 
 
 ### Tips and ideas

 
 
 
 
 - Use color choices as part of prediction effects – the assistant can secretly send the chosen color as soon as it’s selected.
- Combine with Teleport for a visual reveal: display the chosen color not only on the peek device but also as a rendered image on Teleport.
- Pair with physical objects (e.g., colored envelopes, balloons, markers) for strong, everyday-looking mentalism routines.
