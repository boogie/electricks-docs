# Predefined Text

### What is the Predefined Text screen?

 
 
 
 
 The Predefined Text screen lets you store and quickly send custom preset messages from the PeekSmith app to your peek device.

-  An assistant can send rehearsed text (like a prediction or cue) instantly.
- A magician can trigger predefined messages with remotes such as Atom, ATC, MATT+, or Quantum.

This makes it a fast, reliable way to reveal information, deliver cues, or send predictions.

 
 
 
 
 ### How to use Predefined Text

 
 
 
 
 - Open the Predefined Text screen in the PeekSmith app.
- Enter your desired message, phrase, or number in the input field.
- Tap “Send” (or use a remote’s send method) – the text appears on your peek device.

 
 
 
 
 ### Remote controls

 
 
 
 
 You can trigger predefined text hands-free with:

- Atom 2
- ATC and MATT+
- Enter a single number with presses.
- A very long press sends the selected text.
- Quantum
- Numeric buttons select text.
- Other buttons enter spaces.
- Equal (=) sends the text.

This makes Predefined Text ideal for live performances where speed and secrecy matter.

 
 
 
 
 ### Supported devices

 
 
 
 
 The Predefined Text screen works with:

- PeekSmith 3 / SuperPeek
- Bond
- MrCard (via the PeekSmith app, with rotation support)
- Teleport (can receive text or rendered images)

Advanced uses

Predefined Text isn’t just for peeking – it can also trigger advanced actions:

- Send text to Teleport in three different presentation styles.
- Use the new fetch image to Teleport action: define a set of texts in advance, and send them as rendered images – perfect for bold, visual reveals.
- Forward text to a Web API for custom integrations.
- Route text into apps like Inject, Bridge, or Glyphs.
- Speak the text aloud with Text-to-Speech (TTS) (via the Audio Assistant add-on).
