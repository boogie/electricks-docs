# Teleport Settings

In the **Settings** tab of the PeekSmith app, look for the **“Teleport”** section. This area allows you to pair and manage your Teleport device.

 
 
 
 
 ## Connecting Teleport

 
 
 
 
 Tap **“List Devices”** to start scanning for available Bluetooth devices. Once your Teleport device appears, tap it to connect. The app will remember your selection and automatically reconnect next time.

Turn on Auto-Connect, so if the device moves out of Bluetooth range (about 10 meters), it will reconnect automatically when it becomes available again.

To manually disconnect, tap the **“Disconnect”** button.

 
 
 
 
 ## Settings

 
 
 
 
 You can set which design of the poker cards you would like to use (Playing card image), and test sending handwriting and a playing card to the Teleport screen.

 
 
 
 
 ## Teleport Actions

 
 
 
 
 In the PeekSmith app, you can configure external remotes, such as Atom, SB Mote, and others, to trigger custom actions when you press a button. Each button supports Short Press and Long Press configurations.

This allows you to control connected devices like Teleport with a single button press during your performance.

Here are the currently available actions that can be assigned to a remote button when using Teleport:

**Text Buffer → Teleport**

Sends the current contents of the Text Buffer directly to Teleport’s screen as handwritten text.

**Text Buffer → Teleport Paper**

Displays the Text Buffer as handwritten text on a paper-like background.

**Text Buffer → Teleport Yellow Card**

Sends the Text Buffer as handwritten text on a Post-it-like background.

**Playing Card → Teleport**

Displays the recently selected Playing Card on Teleport.

**Doodle Drawing → Teleport**

Sends the current Doodle Drawing to Teleport’s screen – can be used for peeking at the spectator’s sketch or drawing, or displaying a revelation, but keep in mind that a too-perfect prediction is not ideal.
