# Quantum Settings

In the **Settings** tab, the **“Quantum”** section allows you to pair and monitor your Quantum calculator.

 
 
 
 
 ## Connecting Quantum

 
 
 
 
 Tap **“List Devices”** to view nearby Bluetooth devices. Once Quantum appears in the list, tap it to connect. The app will remember the connection and try to reconnect automatically in the future.

Quantum will reconnect automatically when it comes back into Bluetooth range (up to 10 meters).

To disconnect manually, use the **“Disconnect”** button.

More settings and configuration options will be added here as we expand Quantum’s support.
