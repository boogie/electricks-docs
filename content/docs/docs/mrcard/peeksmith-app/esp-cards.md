# ESP Cards

### What is the ESP Cards screen?

 
 
 
 
 The ESP Cards screen lets you display one of six classic ESP symbols on your peek device:

- Circle
- Plus (cross)
- Waves
- Square
- Star
- Infinity

This feature is perfect for mentalism routines, ESP tests, and symbol-based predictions.

- An assistant can send a chosen symbol to the magician‚Äôs peek device.
- A magician can secretly enter a symbol using remotes (Atom, ATC, MATT+, Quantum, etc.) and send it to a peek device, Teleport, or even other apps via the API.

 
 
 
 
 ### How to use ESP Cards

 
 
 
 
 - Open the ESP Cards screen in the PeekSmith app.
- Choose one of the six ESP symbols.
- Tap ‚ÄúSend‚Äù ‚Äì the selected symbol will appear on your device‚Äôs screen.

üí° Tip: On MrCard, you can rotate the display (vertical, upside down) to fit how you hold the card case.

 
 
 
 
 ### Remote controls

 
 
 
 
 Instead of tapping in the app, you can enter symbols hands-free with:

- Atom 2
- ATC and MATT+ (one-button thumb-tip controls)
- Quantum

This makes it possible to set and reveal symbols secretly during performance.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ### Supported devices

 
 
 
 
 The ESP Cards screen works with:

- PeekSmith 3 / SuperPeek
- Bond
- MrCard (via the PeekSmith app, with rotation support)
- Teleport (can display ESP symbols directly)

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ### Extra details

 
 
 
 
 - If you use the Luna Flash deck, the ESP card design on your peek device matches the symbols in the deck exactly ‚Äì making your routines seamless and consistent.
