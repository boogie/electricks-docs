# Swami

### **What is “Swami”?**

The **Swami** function lets you **draw letters or words freehand** in the app, then uses **handwriting recognition (OCR)** to convert them into text and display that text on your PeekSmith-enabled device, such as PeekSmith 3, Bond, or MrCard 

 

### **How to Use Swami**

- In the PeekSmith App, go to the **Swami** screen
- Use your finger or a connected drawing pad to **handwrite each letter**
- The app recognizes and converts the handwriting into text

 

### **Supported Devices**

- Works with any PeekSmith-compatible hardware: **PeekSmith 3**, **Bond**, and **MrCard** 

 

### **Integrations & Uses**

- **Live mentalism reveals**: Draw the spectator’s thought, get instant OCR conversion, and reveal the hidden word
- **Text-to-speech routines**: With Audio Assistant, the converted text can be read aloud

 

### **Setup & Tips**

- **Handwriting clarity** helps recognition—write slowly and clearly
- **Customize recognition settings**: toggle number-only mode, adjust recognition delay, and monitor credit usage in settings 
- You get **initial free OCR credits**; purchase more when needed
