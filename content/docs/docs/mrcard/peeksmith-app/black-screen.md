# Black Screen

### **What is the Black Screen feature?**

A simple yet powerful function that turns the app’s display completely black—perfect for stealth performance, protecting on-screen content, or concealing sensitive routines in your pocket or under wraps 

 

### **When to use Black Screen**

- **Conceal visuals** when the phone is in your pocket or covered
- **Prevent accidental exposure**, ensuring your prep screens remain hidden from audience view
- **Maintain secrecy** between routines while still connected to PeekSmith

 

### **How to Enable/Use**

- Open the PeekSmith App on your device
- Select the **“Black Screen”** option from the main menu 
- The screen will turn entirely black—while the app stays active and ready to send content to your device
- When you’re ready to proceed, exit Black Screen by holding the screen with 1 of your finger.

 

### **Why You Need It**

- **Eyes-down control**: Quickly revert to a blank screen, minimizing audience distraction
- **Visual discretion**: Hide incoming messages or prep work when not needed in the routine
- **Performance finesse**: Toggle discreetly between engagement and concealment without app restarts
