# MrCard Settings

Under the **Settings** tab, look for the **“MrCard”** section to connect and manage your MrCard device.

 
 
 
 
 ## Connecting MrCard

 
 
 
 
 Tap **“List Devices”** to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices. When MrCard appears, tap to connect. The app will automatically remember this connection and try to reconnect next time.

The app will also reconnect automatically when MrCard returns within Bluetooth range (around 10 meters).

To disconnect, simply tap the **“Disconnect”** button.

More configuration options for MrCard will appear in future updates.
