# Dice Screen

The Dice Screen is a simple but powerful addition to the PeekSmith app. It allows you to perform strong routines with nothing more than your phone and your peek device – no extra props required.

With this screen, spectators can roll three virtual dice, freely change their values, and you will see the result instantly on your PeekSmith 3, Bond, or MrCard.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ### How it works

 
 
 
 
 - The screen displays three dice.
- The spectator can tap each die to change its value, ensuring the outcome looks completely fair.
- The individual values are sent in real time to your connected peek device.

This gives you direct access to their hidden choices, opening the door to countless routines.

 
 
 
 
 ### Example Routine

 
 
 
 
 Here’s one practical way to use the Dice Screen:

- Setup: Prepare a deck with your force card at position 20.
- Spectator’s roll: Ask the spectator to roll three dice and freely adjust one of the values. Suppose they end up with 3, 4, 5 (total = 12). You see the result on your peek device.
- Secret calculation: Subtract their total from 20. (20 – 12 = 8.)
- Demonstration: Show them an example with another set of dice (e.g. 2, 2, 4 = 8). Explain that they would simply count 2 cards, then 2, then 4, and turn over the 8th card. Return those 8 cards to the back of the deck.
- The reveal: Now let them use their real dice values (3, then 4, then 5). The last card they turn is your force card.

This force card can be:

- a unique card with writing (e.g. a name or word),
- duplicated in a prediction envelope,
- or used as part of a larger routine.

Notes

- The Dice Screen is designed as a starting point. It gives you an effect to perform immediately with your peek device, even without other props or apps.
