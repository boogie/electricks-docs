# Poker Cards

### What is the Poker Cards screen?

 
 
 
 
 The Poker Cards screen lets you send a playing card to your peek device and display it instantly.

- An assistant can type the suit and value in the PeekSmith app and send it directly to the magician’s device.
- A magician can secretly enter a card using Atom, ATC, MATT+, or Quantum and send it to a peek device, to Teleport, or even to other apps via the API.

This makes it a versatile tool for revelations, predictions, or seamless assistant–magician communication.

 
 
 
 
 ### How to Use Poker Cards

 
 
 
 
 - Open the Poker Cards screen in the PeekSmith app.
- Choose the value (e.g., A, 7, K) and the suit (clubs, hearts, spades, diamonds).
- Tap “Send” – the card shows up on the device’s screen.

💡 Tip: On MrCard, you can rotate the display (vertical, upside down) to match how you hold the card case.

 
 
 
 
 ### Remote controls

 
 
 
 
 Instead of typing in the app, you can enter values hands-free with:

- Atom 2
- ATC or MATT+ (one-button thumb-tip controls)
- Quantum

With all of these remotes, you enter the suit first and the value second.

-  ATC and MATT+:
- A short press counts as +1.
- A long press counts as +5.
- Example: two long presses + two short presses = 11 → Jack.
- Quantum:
- 0 = 10
- 00 = Jack
- 000 = Queen
- . = King

This allows the magician to trigger card reveals or send information on the fly.
