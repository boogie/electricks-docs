# IARVEL Pad

## Introduction

Electricks MrCard  is a revolutionary mentalism device that looks like a regular credit card—but it’s actually a powerful  e‑ink display  and a  remote  control with  6   buttons .

When combined with the  IARVEL PAD Collection it unlocks a new level of control, stealth, and impact in your mentalism routines. Both devices are powerful on their own — but together, they create a seamless, invisible information flow that feels like real mind reading.

### Connecting MrCard with the IARVEL PAD 

- Turn on MrCard  by pressing the  P  button
- Choose  devices  by pressing the  O button
- Move your IARVEL PAD near to MrCard
- It is going to connect via  bluetooth to your Pad

You can connect multiple devices by pressing the  O  button. It will  SEARCH AGAIN  for devices.

### Compatibility

It is compatible with the following products

- IARVEL Post-It
- IARVEL Pad
- IARVEL Pad Pro
- IARVEL Pad Pro Max

### Key Benefits of Using Them Together

- Real-Time Information FlowAs soon as a spectator writes or draws something on the IARVEL Pad, the data is transmitted instantly and silently to the MrCard’s e-ink display. This allows you to peek the information discreetly in real time — without looking at a phone, tablet, or suspicious device.
- Tech free
The IARVEL Pad/Pad Pro/Pad Pro Max looks like a normal notebook or clipboard. The MrCard blends in as a credit card, stage pass, or note tucked in your wallet. Nothing looks like a “magic” device, making your method completely invisible and psychologically clean.
- No Need for a Phone Onstage
Thanks to direct Bluetooth connectivity between devices, you don’t need to rely on your smartphone during performance. This frees up your hands and eliminates tech distractions.

### Conclusion

The combination of MrCard and the IARVEL Pad Family offers a professional-grade solution for modern mentalists. With instant access to spectator input and fully covert handling, you can perform bold, impossible effects with complete confidence — anywhere, anytime.
