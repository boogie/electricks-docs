# MagiScript

## Introduction

```javascript
const name = 'MagiScript';

function main() {
const message = `Hi, it's ${name}.`;
console.log(message);
atom.vibrate('.');
atom.led('g=');
}
```

Welcome to our JavaScript-like programming language designed for magicians ! It is a simple yet powerful tool that allows you to create mini-apps that can help you perform your magic tricks with ease. Whether you’re a hard-core programmer or just starting out, we can help you create custom applications that will take your performance to the next level.

We know that programming can seem intimidating, but you’ll be surprised at how quickly you can create your own mini-apps. With plenty of examples and explanations, you’ll be able to confidently write your own code and bring your magic performances to the next level.

We will cover everything you need to know, from the technical stuff like syntax and data types to functions and control structures. However, it might be more straightforward to just go to the examples to understand what you can achieve.

Our programming language is evolving quickly. We plan to improve the language itself, and the tools around it as well. Feel free to share your ideas and requests with us, we are open. Please understand that everything we are covering here might change rapidly, so visit this site if you have any questions.

## Compatibility

Our goal is to help you to create your mini-apps in as many ways as possible.[ Atom, our intelligent remote](https://electricks.info/product/atom-remote/) is the first product you can try this brand new tool with, however, the plan is to extend the compatibility.

## Help and Support

If you have a question or would like to share your achievements, we have a dedicated Facebook group for you. Feel free to join even if you are interested and do not yet have a compatible product:
