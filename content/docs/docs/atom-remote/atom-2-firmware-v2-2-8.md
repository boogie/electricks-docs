# Atom 2 Firmware v2.2.8

## What's New

 
 
 
 
 Notable changes:

- 
new `atom.id(‘AirPods Pro’);` command to rename the device

- 
changes to the numeric keyboard to be compatible with iThump/Toxic+

- 
new built-in apps (configurable with the MagiScript Editor)

 
You can rename the Atom device using MagiScript, and this change will remain as long as the device is powered on. 

One idea is to create a mini-app that renames the device and assign it to a button (for example, button #6, which is empty by default). Before your presentation, you could launch this mini-app to change the device name, and then open the numeric keyboard mini-app for later use. If you connect to the Atom from a spectator’s phone—perhaps by asking them to open a website, check something, or use a calculator—you could later unlock their phone by entering the pin code (which you would need to obtain beforehand).
 
Additionally, we’ve added some new built-in mini-apps: Atom Stack, Atom Drum, Atom Level, and Jordi Thys’ Poker Hands. You can explore their code and descriptions in the MagiScript documentation: https://electricks.info/docs/magiscript/ (see the Examples in the sidebar). These mini-apps are mostly for fun, but the Atom Thmpr might be useful in a routine as well.
