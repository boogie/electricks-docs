# Atom Square

## Magic Square Generator

Launch this mini-app with button 4 (2nd row-left).

Atom Square is a magic square calculator mini-app. It’s quite simple, you just have to enter a two-digit number, and it prints a magic square to the PeekSmith 3 screen. The minimum number that generates a “perfect” magic square is 22, by entering a smaller number expect some repeated numbers.

The mini-app mirrors and rotates the square so expect different results for the same numbers. Also for larger numbers, it is altering the square. If you would like to have “perfect” magic squares, you can upload the original and basic Atom Square app manually.
