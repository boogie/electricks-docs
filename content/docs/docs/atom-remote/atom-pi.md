# Atom Pi

## Offline Pi Revelations App

Launch this mini-app with button 3 (top-right).

Pi Revelations is a stunning magic trick. With the help of this trick, you can reveal your spectatorâ€™s PIN Number, Passcode, Date Of Birth, or Random Time within the first fifty thousand decimals of Pi. The trick is sold with a book and a link to an indexing website, allowing you to create unbelievable revelations without the need for memory work.

With the Atom Pi mini-app, you can enter a 4-digit number, and it will reveal on PeekSmith where the digits are in the book (page, line number, and column). Atom stores the necessary logic to calculate this information.

Thanks to Badasha Khan for helping me to add this feature.
