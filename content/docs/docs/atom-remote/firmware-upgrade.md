## How to Upgrade

There are two ways to upgrade your device:

- the MagiScript Editor (desktop browser + Bluetooth)

## Update with PeekSmith App

- Install the PeekSmith app , it is a free download.

- Make sure you have logged in to your Apple (on iOS) or Google (on Android) account.

- Make sure Atom is not paired with any other devices during the update to ensure a smooth process.

- Go to Atom’s Details page in the app to do the update.

- If you have problems with the update, try restarting the app and/or your phone to resolve the issue.

## Update with the MagiScript Editor

- You will need a desktop or laptop computer with Bluetooth , and an Edge or Chrome browser. *Latest computers, especially laptops have built-in Bluetooth connectivity.If your computer doesn’t have, you can by a Bluetooth adapter (dongle).*

- Visit the MagiScript Editor at [https://msedit.electricks.info/](https://msedit.electricks.info/) and follow the instructions.
*The editor will automatically offer and do the update, then restarts the device.*
