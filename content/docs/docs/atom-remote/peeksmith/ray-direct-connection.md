# Ray Direct Connection

The feature is implemented in the firmware 1.8.x release.

 
 
 
 
 ## Connection

 
 
 
 
 
Make sure Ray is not connected to an app, and you have the latest PeekSmith 3 firmware. Then press and hold the front right button of PeekSmith 3, and it will start looking for known Bluetooth devices. Shake and turn your Ray to wake it up, andÂ PeekSmith 3 will connect to them. After 20-25 seconds, it will stop scanning for more devices, but you can press the right button to immediately stop the process.

Once connected PeekSmith will display when Ray detects a magnet.
