# Cursor Keyboard

## For Inject 2

Launch this mini-app with button 9 (3rd row-right).

The Cursor Keyboard  (button #9) replicates keyboard cursor keys, facilitating navigation in apps like Inject 2 (by Greg Rostami), where swipe input is utilized. Leveraging all 12 keys of Atom, this keyboard enables effortless finger navigation.
