# Built-In Mini-Apps

## About

## Starting and Stopping the Built-in Mini-Apps

On power on, Atom doesn’t start a mini-app by default, but starts launch mode, and you have 5 seconds to start one of them, just click the button the app assigned to. Later, you can switch to launch mode by double-clicking the power button.

You can setup Atom to start the mini-app you prefer by pressing the power button and the app’s button together. You can clear this setting by pressing the power button and the #12 (Exit/Clear) button together.

In short:

- To start a built-in mini-app, press the power button twice (double click), then the dedicated button.

- To stop the mini-app is running, press the power button twice, and the EXIT button.

- To set up a mini-app to start on power-on, hold the power button, and press the dedicated button.

- To prevent the mini-app start on power-up, hold the power button and press CLR.

## Settings

Atom has dozens of built-in mini-apps, and this number continues to grow with each new firmware release. You can configure which app is assigned to a button in several ways.
