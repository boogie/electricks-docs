# Atom Alias

## Camouflage Your Device

Launch this mini-app with button 6 (2nd row – right).

The Atom Alias mini-app is a building block. It renames your device and can launch an other mini-app (like Atom Unlock).

Certain tricks – like unlocking your spectator’s phone using Atom – may require renaming your device. This ensures you can secretly pair Atom with their phone, and even if it remains visible in their list of paired devices, the name displayed will appear completely innocent, such as “AirPods Pro”.

Please note that renaming your device means the MagiScript Editor or the PeekSmith app won’t be able to locate it by its original name. However, this won’t be an issue if Atom is already connected before renaming.

If Atom Alias isn’t set as the default app when you power on Atom, simply restart the device (by turning it OFF and ON), and it will revert to its original name.

## Configuring Atom Alias with the MagiScript Editor

Connect your Atom to the [MagiScript Editor, and go to Settings](https://electricks.info/docs/magiscript/editor-settings/).

On the Apps tab, you will find the Atom Alias settings. You can set the new name and select the app to be launched. By default the new name is “AirPods Pro”, and the it launches the “Atom Unlock” mini-app.

## Configuring Atom Alias with a PeekSmith 3

The [Settings page](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/settings/) have a video how you can launch the Settings feature of Atom and configure your device if you have a PeekSmith 3 device.

You will find an Apps category, and by entering, Atom Alias related settings. You can set the new name and select the app to be launched. By default the new name is “AirPods Pro”, and the it launches the “Atom Unlock” mini-app.

## Notes

Please note that if your device name reverts to its original name while the spectator’s phone is still within Bluetooth range, the updated name might also revert on their device. To avoid this, we recommend waiting until your show has concluded before making any changes.
