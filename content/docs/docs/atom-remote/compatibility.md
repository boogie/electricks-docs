# Compatibility

## Apps and Devices

Atom is compatible with a wide range of devices, and you can check back here for the updated list. There are at least three ways Atom can be compatible with an app or device:

- An app implements support and connects directly to Atom via Bluetooth, like the [PeekSmith](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/peeksmith/) and [TimeSmith](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/timesmith/) apps.

- Atom’s Bluetooth Keyboard mode , launching in June, allows compatibility with other apps, like Inject, by entering information like any other keyboard.

- MagiScript scripts running on Atom can directly connect to devices, currently supporting PeekSmith and SB Watch, with plans to add more. You can also program Atom and update its firmware using the MagiScript editor in a web browser.

You can program Atom and update its firmware with our [web browser-based MagiScript editor](https://peeksmith.electricks.info/atom/).

## App Support

- [TimeSmith](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/timesmith/) app – you can connect your Atom to set the time.

- [PeekSmith](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/peeksmith/) app – you can input numeric information, assign actions to the buttons (like sending the numbers to Glyphs, Web API call, or Pi Revelations), and do firmware updates.

- [Inject 2](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/inject-2/) app – you can enter information with swipes

## Direct Connection

Currently, these are available with [MagiScript](https://electricks.info/docs/magiscript/). You can use our examples to discover the features and upload mini-apps to Atom.

- PeekSmith 3 – Atom can send text and vibration patterns, and read buttons and accelerometer data.

- SB Watch – Atom can set a time, reset the watch to the current time, and read the crown button and accelerometer data.
