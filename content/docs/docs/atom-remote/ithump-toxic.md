# iThump/Toxic

## Introduction

iTHUMP/Toxic+ is a powerful tool for magicians, combining a thumper (iTHUMP) and calculator routines (Toxic+) into one app.

It is by far the most full-featured Magic Calculator ever conceived and was one of the first apps supporting PeekSmith and SB Watch. It is perfect for stage or close up performances. It handles just like a regular calculator but allows you to force the result of the calculation more efficiently than any other method.

## With Atom

Since version 2.5.13, it adds support for Atom. With Atomâ€™s Numeric Keyboard, users can now input numbers, control app features, and set the time on hybrid watches, making it more versatile for a variety of routines. For more details, please contact Ian Pidgeon directly.
