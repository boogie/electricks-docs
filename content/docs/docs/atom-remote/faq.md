# FAQ

## What Makes Atom Unique?

Atom’s most unique feature is running MagiScript mini-apps. This opens the opportunity for community members to create and customize routines based on their ideas in minutes. There’s no need to know a lot about Bluetooth communication or setting up a development environment, or app store submissions. Just create an app.

You also get regular firmware updates to get more and more features.

## How Can I Hide Atom?

We have several ideas:

- Palming: you can palm Atom in your hand.

- Pocket: put Atom into your pocket, and press the buttons when you are adding or removing something from your pocket.

- Pocket 2: you can feel and press the buttons through your trouser material.

- Hiding it in an object: you can keep Atom on a board, or in a card box, and press the buttons.

## Have to Learn Programming to Use Atom?

No. First of all, Atom is compatible with several apps out of the box. Just connect Atom, and start using them. We have also preloaded dozens of MagiScript apps for you, so you don’t have to care about how MagiScript works. And we have example code you can review and customize without fully understanding how it works.

We are[ here](https://electricks.info/docs/magiscript/) for you to help you learn to program. MagiScript is an easy-to-learn language, and a lot of examples of code is available for you to understand the concepts. Maybe it won’t be as easy as LEGO but will be close to it.

## How Can I Charge The Device?

You can charge it with the USB-C port. Plug it with the included cable to your computer or wall charger. The device can be on or off. When the device is off, it will obviously charge faster. You can turn it on to read the battery percentage. When you are charging the device, a slightly higher battery percentage will be reported.

## How long Atom is Working Fully Charged?

We have not yet conducted a measurement with the final hardware and firmware. Our plan was 8 hours, and we can say it takes many hours to discharge Atom.

## What Are the Dimensions of the Atom Remote?

The dimensions of the Atom Remote is: 32mm x 65mm x 13mm

## Is There a Way to Make Atom Connect to X App?

Atom can work with apps directly (the app developer needs to add support), via apps like PeekSmith (like sending data to a Web API) or as a Bluetooth Keyboard. Read more about it on our *[Compatibility page](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/compatibility/).*

## Is There a Way to Reset My Atom 2 Back to Factory Settings?

Yes, you can reset Atom without deleting its stored contents. This option is useful if you’ve misconfigured Atom and want to restore the default settings. Turn off Atom and connect it to the charger. Press and hold the bottom-right button (#12) for about 3 seconds, until Atom vibrates twice.

## Is it Hard to Differentiate Between Each Button?

Stick a self-adhesive little sticky gem on any button to easily find that button.
