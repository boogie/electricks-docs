# Numeric Keyboard

## Enter Numbers

Launch this mini-app with button 7 (3rd row-left).

The Numeric Keyboard  (button #7) streamlines number input with dedicated keys for submission and backspace. Long-pressing the submit key inserts a separator key, which you can customize to input a comma or comma and space. This update optimizes number entry by automatically inserting the separator key after a specified number of digits or time delay. Additionally, the submit key can activate after a set duration. Smart features ensure efficient usage, such as automatically deleting inserted separators.
