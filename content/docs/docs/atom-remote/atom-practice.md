# Atom Practice

## Practice Entering Time

Launch this mini-app with button 5 (2nd row-middle).

You can practice entering time confidently without watching by using this mini-app. It is a simple game to help you, first, it generates a random time, and then you have to enter it correctly. When connected to a browser (using the [MagiScript editor](https://peeksmith.electricks.info/atom/)), it will also tell you the time with an Audio Assistant, and give you feedback if you were successful or not.
