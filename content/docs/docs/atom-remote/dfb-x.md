# DFB-X

## Introduction

DFB-X is an iOS app by Marc Kerstein. It lets you force any one of 100 items in a list.

## DFB-X Supports

DFB X supports both keyboard remotes that just send key presses AND the specific Atom characteristic.

You donâ€™t need a Bluetooth keyboard mini-app on Atom if you connect Atom from the DFB X app, and the advantage is that it will work if the app is in the background too.
