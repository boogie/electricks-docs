# Atom Unlock

## Unlock the Spectator's Phone

To launch, first assign a button to this mini-app

With the Atom Unlock built-in mini-app, you can unlock a spectator’s phone by typing their PIN code – without touching their phone! While a few steps are involved, here’s how it works:

- First, you need to obtain the PIN code. This can be done pre-show or using an app like iThump/Toxic, where the spectator enters their PIN, and you can discreetly peek at it.

- Next, connect Atom to their phone. You can do this by having them unlock their phone, claiming you need to load a webpage. Then, quickly navigate to the Bluetooth settings and pair Atom. Once connected, you can truly load a webpage – such as Inject – and proceed with your performance. 

 
And you are ready to unlock the phone later during your show.

## Launching and Using the Atom Unlock Mini-app

By default, the Atom Unlock mini-app is not assigned to any button, however, it is launched by the [Atom Alias](https://electricks.info/docs/atom-remote/atom-alias/) mini-app, which renames your Atom to a device like “AirPods Pro”. You can launch it with button #6 (when Atom is in launch mode).

Then you can enter a four or six digit number on the keyboard of Atom, and press the Submit button (bottom-left) and basically you are ready to go. Atom will slowly repeat the numbers, and imitate typing them, and in the end, the phone becomes unlocked.
