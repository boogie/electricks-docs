# Atom Card

Launch this mini-app by pressing button 2 (top-middle) during the 5-second startup window.  💡 Atom Card is available starting from firmware v2.4.1. It replaces Atom Stack on button 2 by default. If you’d like to use Atom Stack instead, you can change this in the launcher settings. Atom Card lets you send a playing card to Teleport – perfect for revealing bold predictions. You can also use it with PeekSmith 3, allowing an assistant to send the selected card during a performance.

### Configuration

To use the Atom Card mini-app with Teleport, you’ll need to choose a display style. Open the Settings and look for the “Send to Teleport” option under the Atom Stack section. You can pick from:- Poker card
- Bridge card
- Tilted card
- Off (don’t send to Teleport)

You can choose between two ways to enter a card:- Simple (CHDS) Pos – Enter the card’s position in a CHDS-ordered stack (Clubs → Hearts → Diamonds → Spades, Ace to King). Example: 1 = ♣A, 14 = ♦A, 27 = ♥A, 40 = ♠A
- CHDS, Value – Press once to select the suit (1=♣, 2=♦, 3=♥, 4=♠), then press again to select the value (1=A to 13=K).

You can also visit our [Atom Card page](http://(https://electricks.info/docs/teleport/atom-card/))  in the Teleport documentation.
