# International Keyboards

### About

Bluetooth keyboard support is initially designed to work with Latin (specifically English) letters by default. We are committed to expanding this support to encompass as many languages as possible, beginning with English and European languages, and then extending it to non-Latin alphabets. The behavior varies between iOS and Android platforms; it’s a complex topic that we are actively studying.

While Atom can be connected to Windows, Mac, and Linux as well, we are not focusing on supporting these platforms.
