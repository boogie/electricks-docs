# Media Controls

## Control Music

Launch this mini-app with button 10 (4th row-left).

With the Media Keyboard  (button #10), you gain control over volume and music playback on your phone, compatible with various platforms including Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube. Furthermore, certain apps can detect volume up/down key presses, ensuring compatibility. For example, SB Mote and selfie remotes send volume-up signals, so apps supporting them should be compatible with this keyboard, too.
