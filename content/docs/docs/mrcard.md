# Electricks MrCard - The Ultimate Stealth Mentalism Device

MrCard is a groundbreaking tool in the world of mentalism, expertly disguised as a standard credit card. It features:

- Ultrathin e-ink display

- 6 silent buttons
It allows performers to control and reveal information with total discretion. Lightweight and compact, it fits naturally into a wallet, making it ideal for everyday carry or improvised performances.

MrCard can operate with other Bluetooth-enabled magic tools, such as the SB Watch , IARVEL Pad family, and the IARVEL Watch .

## Charging MrCard

![](https://electricks.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/mrcard-charger-1024x400.png)

MrCard may arrive with an empty battery. If you‚Äôre eager to start using it right away, just a few minutes of charging will be enough to power it on. However, we recommend giving it a full charge before your first performance.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not insert MrCard upside down when charging ‚Äì it may damage or scratch the screen.

Use the included custom charger with the USB-C port. You can plug it into a computer‚Äôs USB port, a standard wall adapter, or a car charger. Please note: some high-power chargers may not be compatible.

The charger has two indicator lights:

- Green LED ‚Äì shows that the charger is powered.

- Blue LED ‚Äì shows the charging status:

Blinking : Charging is in progress

- Solid : Charging is complete

üí° Important: Always make sure your MrCard is charged before any performance.

## Turning ON and OFF

Easy first steps:

- To turn ON: Press the P button once.

- To turn OFF : Press and hold the P button for a few seconds.

After you turn the device on, you can select operation mode with the buttons. The X button acts as an up arrow, the A button acts as a down arrow, and the O button selects the behaviour.
¬†
Select *Devices* to enter the Standalone Mode . Now it connects to other devices.
Or select *Apps* to enter the App Mode , and you can connect to it with apps, like the [PeekSmith app](https://electricks.info/docs/mrcard/peeksmith-app/).
