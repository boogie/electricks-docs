# FAQ

## What Makes Ray Unique?

Ray, our magnetic sensor device, employs state-of-the-art technology to pinpoint magnetic coins or objects accurately. When it detects a magnetic coin, it prompts your device to vibrate, indicating the coin’s hidden location or the presence of a magnetized object. 

Offering a detection range of up to 20 cm (may vary by device, and the magnetic strength of the object), Ray ensures user-friendly operation and broad compatibility.

Ray is flexible about how you use it, it can be palmed or can be hidden in a wristband. Both will work well.

Last, but not least, Ray has more capabilities. It includes a very sensitive motion sensor and an accelerometer. They can be used to improve the magnet sensing features or for motion recognition. We are dedicated to utilizing these features as well.
