# Enchanted Melody

The magic routine called “Enchanted Melody” involves selecting a random audience member to come on stage to read the audience mind. The magician displays the name of a famous song on a large piece of paper for the entire audience to see, but the spectator on the stage is not allowed to see it (use the bandana). The twist is that the audience members must sing the song in their minds only, without uttering a word. Using the power of Mental Wave, the spectator can successfully read the thoughts, revealing the exact name of the song they were thinking of. This routine creates an engaging and captivating experience.

## Example Presentation

Magician : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an extraordinary evening of magic and mind reading! Tonight, we’re going to embark on a journey deep into the realm of the mind. I need your participation for this to work, so let’s have some fun together. I need someone to join me on stage. How about you, sir? Yes, you, with the bright smile. Please, come on up!

*A random audience member comes up on stage.*Magician : (Shakes hands with the spectator) What’s your name?

Spectator: John.

Magician : Great to have you here, John. Now, here’s what we’re going to do. I want you to be my channel to the collective mind of our amazing audience. You’re about to be the star of this show!

*The magician discreetly places a bandana (with Mental Wave) on John’s head, explaining this way he won’t be able to cheat.*Magician : To begin, I want you all to think of a famous song. I don’t want to influence you ( *The magician holds up the large paper with large easy to read words: “Bohemian Rhapsody* “ *, encouraging the audience to think about this song* ). Yes, a song you like, but please don’t say it out loud. Keep that song locked away in your minds. Now, please stay quiet, and think about this song. It is okay to sing it in your mind to help John.

Magician : John, I want you to focus on the song the audience is thinking about. Don’t say a word yet, but concentrate on the melody and the lyrics. Open your mind to hear the song. Are you ready?

*Spectator nods.*Magician : Alright, ladies and gentlemen, keep the song strong in your minds, and let’s make this magic happen!

*The magician takes a moment, first plays a short part of the song with Mental Wave. John might already know the name of the song, but the magician prepared with an audio that tells the exact name and performer of the song as well, and plays it if necessary.Spectator looks surprised.*Magician : (Excitedly) John, do you have any idea now about the song?

John : I’m getting something! Ithink the song is the “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen!

Magician : Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give John a round of applause! (Audience claps) And for the grand finale, let’s see the title on the big paper!
