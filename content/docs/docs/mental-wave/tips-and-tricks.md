# Tips and Tricks

## About

This page provides useful tips and tricks to enhance the performance of your bone conduction device and reduce leaking sound for an optimal listening experience. Please follow these recommendations to make the most of your device.

## Properly Positioning the Transducer

The transducer is a critical component of the bone conduction device that directly contacts your (or the spectator’s) skull to transmit audio. For the best audio quality and performance, it is essential to place the bone conduction device correctly on your skull. The optimal placement may vary from person to person, depending on their individual anatomy and preferences.

To ensure efficient sound transmission, follow these steps:

- Locate the red circled silver part on the bone conduction device; this is the transducer.

- Apply firm pressure to the transducer to ensure it adheres closely to your skull. The stronger the contact, the better the sound conduction.

To identify the optimal placement:

- Position the transducer directly on the area of your skull where you want to receive sound vibrations. See the [Optimal Placements](https://electricks.info/docs/mental-wave/optimal-placements/) page to figure out the ideal positions.

- Experiment with different positions on your skull while paying attention to sound quality and comfort.

- Once you find the spot that delivers the clearest sound and most comfortable fit, remember that location for future use.

## Using a Bandana for Extra Stability

In certain situations, you may find that using a bandana helps keep the bone conduction device in place. To achieve a snug fit and prevent any sliding or movement, consider adding a knot to the bandana . This will provide extra stability during activities that involve significant head movement.

For more tips related to the bandana, please read the [Working with the Bandana](https://electricks.info/docs/mental-wave/working-with-the-bandana/) page.

## Encourage Spectators to Cover Their Ears

When using the bone conduction device in a public setting or in front of an audience, it’s essential to create an optimal listening experience while also ensuring the device remains inconspicuous. To achieve this:

- Encourage the spectator to cover their ears while you use the bone conduction device.

- Alternatively, you can ask them to place a finger gently in their ears during the performance or presentation.

- This not only enhances the sound quality for the person using the device but also creates the illusion that the sound is being sensed rather than heard, making the experience more magical and intriguing.

Please note that while these tips and tricks can significantly improve the performance of the Mental Wave bone conduction device, individual experiences may still vary.
