# Revealing Information

## A Way to Reveal Information

While it is not a routine itself, revealing information with the device allows you to present an extraordinary and captivating experience for both performers and audiences alike. With Mental Wave, the act of revealing information becomes an immersive and interactive journey, captivating the minds and hearts of those witnessing the performance.

Using Mental Wave you can integrate a second participant into the act. This chosen individual becomes the center of attention as they seemingly possess uncanny mental abilities. Whether itâ€™s a written message, a selected card, a dice roll, or any other secret information, Mental Wave empowers this participant to instantaneously reveal the concealed data, leaving the audience in utter amazement. The shared experience between the performer and the participant creates a strong sense of wonder and connection, making the performance truly memorable. Shifting the focus to the second participant makes these effects deeper and stronger.

## Performing

There are more ways to achieve this effect:

- If you are collecting the information electronically (think about a Spotted Dice roll, NFC/RFID reader, an electronic board, Inject, etc.), then you can let a phone announce this information. If you can use only a basic text-to-speech engine, this might be not the ideal way as the second spectator can recognize the generated voice easily, but you can still make it magical for the second spectator.

- You can peek or collect the information yourself (using electronics or not) and trigger the revelation using a remote. This way you have good control when the revelation happens.

- Finally, if you are working with an assistant, your assistant can whisper the information by setting up a call (regular phone call, Messenger, Whatsapp, etc.)

In summary, utilizing Mental Wave to reveal information enhances your presentation, deeply involves your audience, and adds an enchanting touch, making your routine truly magical.
