# Optimal Placements

## About Bone Conduction

Bone conduction is a fascinating technology that allows sound to be transmitted through bone vibrations rather than through the air like traditional speakers. Bone conduction devices work by placing a transducer against the bone, typically near the ear, to create vibrations that travel directly to the inner ear. This means that the sound is heard without obstructing the ears, leaving them free to listen to the audience or participate in the act seamlessly.

## Optimal Placements

According to research there are locations on the head those are more optimal than others to use the bone transducer at.
