# Special Flash Decks (Letters, Numbers, Colors, ESP)

We’ve created a variety of specialized decks from our flash cards, giving you flexibility to choose the one that best suits your needs.

Letters

The Letters Deck contains 2 complete sets of 26 cards, each featuring all letters from A to Z.

With two of each letter, you can create engaging routines such as spelling predictions, word revelations, or even memory demonstrations where your audience “randomly” selects letters. The double set of letters also gives you the flexibility to spell out most common names and words, making this deck a versatile tool for a wide variety of effects.

Numbers

The Numbers Deck  consists of 5 complete sets of 10 cards, each featuring all numbers from 0 to 9.

With this setup, you can create any five-digit number, allowing for a multitude of creative routines. Numbers hold significant meaning in magic, as they can represent personal details like a participant’s birth year, a PIN code, or even a lucky number. Combine this deck with our SB Watch products to predict a time with them.

You can craft powerful effects where you predict or reveal these numbers, enhancing the emotional connection with your audience. Additionally, this deck is perfect for performing mathematical miracles, number games, or even interactive routines where participants think of their favorite numbers.

Colors

The Colors deck contains 5 sets of 10 cards, each showcasing a vibrant range of colors.

This colorful selection enables you to create visually stunning effects. You can develop routines based on color associations, intuitive choices, or even audience participation games where individuals select colors that resonate with them. Colors can also serve as symbols for emotions or themes, allowing you to tailor your performances to different contexts, such as love, luck, or creativity. The vibrant hues in this deck will captivate your audience and enhance the overall visual impact of your presentations.

ESP Symbols

This deck includes 10 sets of 6 cards, each featuring the 5+1 classic ESP symbols: Circle, Cross, Wavy Lines, Square, Star, and the additional Infinity sign.

The ESP Symbols deck is perfect for mentalism and psychic demonstrations, enabling you to create compelling routines that explore intuition and perception. You can perform classic tests of ESP, allowing participants to match symbols or predict their choices, which can create a sense of wonder and intrigue. These symbols can also represent various concepts, such as elements of nature or emotional states, providing deeper layers of meaning to your performances. The versatility of this deck makes it an essential tool for anyone looking to engage their audience in a thought-provoking and entertaining way.
