# Special Poker Decks

We’ve crafted a variety of special decks from our poker cards, including a two-way force deck and a Mnemonica deck .

Mnemonica

The cards are arranged in Mnemonica order, a powerful and versatile stack created by legendary magician Juan Tamariz. This prearranged order allows you to open the box and immediately start performing your favorite routines that rely on this ingenious setup. With Mnemonica, you can perform mind-reading, stunning predictions, and seemingly impossible card effects — all without any prep work.

In addition, the included seal stickers let you reseal the box, creating the perfect illusion that the deck is brand new and in standard order. This small but effective touch reinforces the idea that the deck hasn’t been manipulated, adding an extra layer of mystery to your performance.

Two-Way Force

A two-way force deck is a specialized deck of cards designed to force two specific cards during a magic routine. The deck is split evenly, containing 26 identical black cards (e.g., 26 Kings of Spades) and 26 identical red cards (e.g., 26 Aces of Diamonds). This setup allows you to “force” a participant to choose one of these two predetermined cards, depending on how you present the deck.

This deck is versatile for routines where you need to reveal two different cards or want to create the illusion of free choice while maintaining control of the outcome.
