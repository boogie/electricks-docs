# Marking System – Flash Cards

We’ve designed it to be intuitive, requiring minimal effort to learn. But it’s subtle enough to fly under the radar. Check out the other illustration to see how we’ve marked the flash cards.

## Left and Right Part

Flash cards are a little different compared to poker cards. The numbers have the number on the left, similar to poker cards, and a star on the right. Letters have the letter on the left and a diamond-like tiny dot on the right. ESP symbols have a number on the left and a curvy line symbolizing a written “e” on the right. Finally, colors have two letters from the color – as we had to solve marking Black, Blue, and Brown. BK is black, BE is blue, and OR is orange in the picture.
