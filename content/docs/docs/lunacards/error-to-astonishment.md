# Error to Astonishment

This tutorial showcases a baffling self-working mind-reading card trick that turns a wrong prediction into a stunning revelation. After the spectator freely shuffles the deck, selects a card, and secretly remembers its position, the magician confidently makes an incorrect guess. But the twist? The magician then reveals the chosen card at precisely the position the spectator recalls. With no setup, no sleight of hand, and a jaw-dropping finale, this routine is a surefire way to leave your audience amazed and questioning the impossible.
