# Flash Card Tricks

We are showcasing two exciting tricks with the Luna Flash Playing Cards that are sure to captivate any audience.

- The Word Reveal: A self-working card trick where a random card selection leads to an astonishing revelation — the letters on the cards spell out “BEAR” in perfect order. Simple to set up and perform, this trick is as magical as it is fun!

- Marked Match: A clever use of the Luna cards’ marking system allows you and the spectator to accurately guess each other’s chosen card, creating a seemingly impossible mind-reading effect.
