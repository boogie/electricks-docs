# Intuition Trick

In this tutorial, we unravel a self-working card trick that combines several ingenious principles to create an awe-inspiring effect. Ideal for the Luna Playing Cards, this routine enables magicians to demonstrate uncanny intuition and connection with their spectators. With its seemingly impossible conclusion, this trick is guaranteed to leave audiences stunned.

 
 
 
 
 The performance begins with both the magician and spectator shuffling their respective halves of the deck. The magician places cards face down, asking the spectator to intuitively match their colors without revealing them. The grand finale? Not only do the colors align, but the chosen cards also perfectly pair as mates!

 
 
 
 
 The Luna deckâ€™s design makes this trick exceptionally clean and powerful, providing built-in tools like marked cards and the double-backer for seamless execution. This routine will be an impressive addition to your repertoire.
