# Specifications

Basically it is a normal looking 16mm dice set, with a special Bluetooth-enabled electronics inside the dice. There are no other Bluetooth-dice on the market, for other dice you need a thumper to connect them to your phone. We have designed them to look and feel like ordinary dice used with board games.

The “16mm” dice are about 16.5 mm. It is almost the same size as the most common 16mm playing dice, and the difference is only noticeable when they’re next to each other. You can easily swap the dice with a regular 16mm one, and hand them out to the spectator as a gift. The “19mm” dice are exactly 19mm.
