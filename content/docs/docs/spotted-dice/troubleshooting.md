## Can't Connect to the Spotted Dice

If you are experiencing difficulty connecting your Spotted Dice to your phone, it may be due to a setting issue or a low battery. Even if the Spotted Dice seems to be functioning on its own, the Spotted Dice may not have enough power to maintain a Bluetooth connection. To troubleshoot this issue, you can check the following:

- Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone.

- Ensure that no other devices or apps are currently connected to the Spotted Dice.

- Consider charging the Spotted Dice.

- Keep in mind that phones have a limit on the number of devices they can connect to at one time. If you have many other devices (such as a fitness band or earphones) connected to your phone, try disconnecting some of them to see if this resolves the issue. Most modern phones can connect to 10-16 devices at once.

- Try restarting your phone, or moving at least 20 meters away from other devices to see if this helps to disconnect any other devices that may be connected to your watch.

## For Android

- Make sure that GPS is enabled on your device. GPS may be required for Bluetooth communication to work properly.

- Allow the app to access Bluetooth and/or location services.

- Note that there may be some bugs in the Bluetooth implementation on Android devices. If you are experiencing connection issues, try turning on and off the flight mode, or restarting your phone.

## For iOS

- Allow the app to access Bluetooth and/or location services.
