# Full App Activation

In the app please go to “ Settings ” – “ USER SETTINGS “, and tap the text “ click here to sign in ” near “ Account “.

A new page will pop up, where you’ll have to tap the button that says “ Sign in with Apple ” (iOS) or “ Select Google account ” (Android). On iOS you can hide your real email from the app, it won’t matter. When you’re logged in, your  Account ID  will be displayed on the Settings screen near  “Account”.Tap your Account ID, and you’ll see an input field where you can enter your activation code. You can also  paste the code  from the clipboard by tapping the document icon below the field. After inserting the code, tap the green checkmark and your code will be validated.

If everything is OK, the  FULL version will be activated  for your account, and you can use it  on any iOS or Android device  where you log in with the same account.
