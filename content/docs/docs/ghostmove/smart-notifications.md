# Smart Notifications

You can display secret information on any smartwatch or smart band connected to your phone. It is sent and displayed as a notification on all smart devices that support it.

The following video demonstrates this feature in the PeekSmith app (it is called Local Notifications there), but it works the same.

## Turning on Smart Notifications

Navigate to the settings menu in your GhostMove app, find “accessories,” and within that, you need to enable “smart notifications.”
