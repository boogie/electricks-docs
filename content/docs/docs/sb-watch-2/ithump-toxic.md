# iThump/Toxic+

## Introduction

The iThump/Toxic+ app is a native iPhone/iPad app created by Ian Pidgeon. It is by far the most full featured Magic Calculator ever conceived, and was one of the first apps supporting PeekSmith and SB Watch. It is perfect for stage or close up performances.

It can be made to look exactly the way you want it to (by importing your own screenshots as the background) and can be used to perform amazing feats of mind reading, prediction and mentalism.

It handles just like a regular calculator but allows you to force the result of the calculation more efficiently than any other method.

## How to Use

Please refer to the iThump/Toxic+ app’s documentation (https://www.toxicplus.com/) or contact Ian Pidgeon about using it with an SB Watch.
