# Changing the Straps

## What You Will Need

Changing the straps on your SB Watch is a straightforward process that can be easily done with the right tools. Make sure you have the right straps, for SB Watch wristwatches you can use 20mm wide straps, while the SB Watch Steel models need 22mm wide straps.

The ideal tool for this job is a spring bar tool, which makes the process quick and easy. However, if you don’t have a spring bar tool, a small screwdriver can also be used to remove the old strap and attach the new one.

This guide will walk you through the process step by step, so you can change your watch strap with confidence.

## Steps

SB Watch has straps with string bars. A spring bar is a small, thin metal rod to attach straps or bands to watches or other types of jewelry. It has a small spring inside that allows it to be compressed and inserted into the holes or lugs on the watch case, and then released to hold the strap securely in place. Spring bars are often used to attach watch bands or straps to the watch case because they are easy to install and remove, and they provide a secure and adjustable fit.

The 2022 models have quick-release spring bars, if you are replacing your strap with a new one, we recommend using a quick-release one, because it is even easier to remove and install them.

Remove the spring bars: Take the edge of the spring bar tool or the screwdriver on it and press them down into the spring bars. Apply firm pressure to pop them out. Repeat the process on both sides of the watch.

Replace the spring bars: Insert the spring bars into your new strap. Most straps are coming with spring bards, so just skip this step if this is the case for you.

Reassemble the watch: Repeat the process in reverse, remembering to apply firm pressure as you do so.

Enjoy your new look: Your watch is now fully customized with a new strap.
