## How Can I Place an Order for the Watch?

You can buy them in our Electricks Magic Shop: [SB Watch 2](https://electricks.info/product/sb-watch-2/).

## What Are the Dimensions of the Watch?

The SB Watch 2 is roughly 42mm watch with standard strap.

## Does the Watch Have a Crown?

SB Watch 2  have a crown-button, and 2 optional buttons (Noir Black Three, Noir Silver Three).

## What Kind of Sources Will Be Supported for Peeking?

The free PeekSmith app supports various sources like Inject, WikiTest, and Ellipse, just to name a few. We’re also collaborating with app developers for seamless integration.

## Which Model is Best for Me?

Each SB Watch 2 model is excellent. The Noir Collection offers lifestyle elegance with sleek black faces and customizable straps. With a standard-sized, convenient strap, customization to match your unique style is effortless. It comes in two case colors, black and silver, and offers variations with a crown-only or a crown plus two buttons.

 

## Do I Need the Additional Buttons?

You will be able to assign actions in the compatible apps to the buttons, also Atom 2’s MagiScript will be able to handle them. I think it is a great opportunity if you would like to use it as a remote to trigger some things, like clearing the screen on the PeekSmith 3 or sending information to a Web API, etc.

## Do I Need PeekSmith 3 for the Watch?

While we think PeekSmith 3 is a great device, you don’t need it for using the watch. The PeekSmith app will be able to connect directly to the watch.

The screen will have a lot of use cases, but please note, that it is smaller and has a lower resolution than the PeekSmith 3 screen, and it is a black-and-white display, compared to the PS3’s color screen. The information it can display is more limited.

Also, having a PeekSmith 3 on the table can give you visual feedback about the time you have set, if you are using the watch face down, then you won’t be able to look at its screen.

## Why No Seconds Hand?

The reason for this approach is to enhance the impact of the effect. When a watch has a second hand, the spectator can observe whether it’s ticking or not. In contrast, if there’s no second hand, you can conveniently set a “frozen time” at any moment, even minutes before the reveal. This eliminates concerns about the watch’s functionality. We’ve been crafting these watches for over three years, and the feedback has been consistently positive regarding this design choice.

## Will There Be an SB Watch 2 Pocket Watch, and Are There Plans for Other Models?

We’re evaluating the pocket watch design’s feasibility. Regarding future models, we follow a similar approach as with our first series. Depending on demand and the pace at which these models are sold, you can anticipate new designs, possibly on an annual basis. Stay tuned for updates on future models.

## Is the Crown Functional, and What Do the Optional Buttons Do?

Absolutely, the crown is not just for show; we’ve implemented a convincing solution that gives the appearance of a working crown. In practice, it is “just” a turnable button, and both the crown and the optional buttons provide configurable behavior, enabling personalization with actions tailored to your preferences.

When used as a prediction watch, you might choose to keep it discreet with no visible actions assigned. However, the true versatility comes to light when using it as a remote or peek device. Seize the opportunity to leverage a broad spectrum of choices for assigning actions to these buttons – most of our apps will support these buttons.

## Is the Display Noticeable?

Not at all. We intentionally chose a black face to conceal it, and based on feedback from those who have seen it at Blackpool, it remains inconspicuous. In direct sunlight or strong light, there’s a specific angle where it might be visible – even then, spectators may not recognize what it is. Importantly, spectators have no reason to search for it, and your presentation should center on the hands and prediction, leaving them no opportunity to even consider looking for it.

## How Long Do the New Watches Hold a Charge?

The new watches feature a rechargeable battery with a concealed charging port. While exact battery life varies, they can operate for up to a week with regular use, possibly longer. Expect updates as we finalize firmware and gather user feedback.

## Is it Working Like an Everyday Watch?

Yes, it is. Our watches can show you the time all day.

## I Don’t Care about the TimeSmith App, I Would Like to Use a Remote!

Introducing [Atom 2](https://electricks.info/product/atom-remote/), our intelligent remote. It seamlessly connects to the watch and supports MagiScript for personalized solutions. Owners of Thoughtcast Versa or Wilson Nexus remotes can also connect directly to SB Watch 2.

## I’m Not Convinced, What Can I Do?
