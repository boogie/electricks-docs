In the PeekSmith app, you can not only connect to PeekSmith, you can also connect and use it with many other devices. See in side menu bar.

## With the PeekSmith App

Start the app, and go to Settings. You will see different sections, in the first one, the “CONNECT DEVICES”, you should see an “SB Watch 2” title and a “List devices” button. Tap the button, and your watch should be listed there. Tap on the device name, and it should connect, and display a “READY” message on its screen. Please note that the watch can only be connected to one app or remote at a time, which means if you would like to connect it from the TimeSmith or an other app, or an Atom or other remote, you need to exit in the PeekSmith app first.

Try sending messages to the watch by going to the “Start” page, and selecting “send text”, “poker cards” or “colors”. This is how your assistant can send you messages. Read our docs about “[Web Polling](https://electricks.info/docs/peeksmith-3/web-polling/)” in the PeekSmith documentation for setting up other sources.

By default, the watch activates message display when you raise your hand to “check the time”. This  *will be*  configurable in the PeekSmith app. Ensure that your hand is positioned to shield the screen from onlookers, and the message will appear. Once you lower your hand, the message will vanish. The watch retains messages for a duration of 30 seconds.
