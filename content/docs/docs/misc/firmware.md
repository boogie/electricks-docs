# Firmware Updates

This page explains how to update the firmware on your Electricks devices, why itâ€™s important, and how to avoid common problems. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures the best performance, reliability, and access to the latest features.

 
 
 
 
 ## What is Firmware? (And How Itâ€™s Different from App Updates)

 
 
 
 
 Firmware is the software that runs inside your physical device â€” such as PeekSmith, Atom, SB Watch, or Quantum. It controls the deviceâ€™s behavior: the screen, buttons, Bluetooth connection, vibration, and other hardware functions.

A firmware update upgrades the internal software on the device itself.

This is not the same as an app update.

- An app update upgrades the mobile app you use on your phone or tablet (like the PeekSmith app, Atom Remote app, or Quantum app).
- A firmware update upgrades the internal system of the physical product.

Â Example:

- Firmware update: Adds a new vibration pattern to your Atom remote, improves Bluetooth stability on PeekSmith, or enhances battery handling on Quantum.
- App update: Adds new menus, features, or settings in the app itself.

Important: Updating the app does not update the firmware â€” and updating the firmware does not update the app. They are separate but sometimes both are needed to enable new features.

 
 
 
 
 ## Why Firmware Updates Matter

 
 
 
 
 Firmware updates can:

- Fix bugs and glitches.
- Improve Bluetooth stability and connection reliability.
- Add new features and enhancements.
- Optimize battery life and performance.
- Improve compatibility with apps, iOS, Android, and other connected devices.

 
 
 
 
 ## When to Update (and When Not To)

 
 
 
 
 âœ… Update if:

- A new feature is released that you want to use.
- The update fixes issues that affect you.
- Support has recommended an update to solve a problem.

ðŸš« Avoid updating if:

- You have an important performance within a few hours.
- Everything is working perfectly for your current needs.

Tip: Updating firmware should be done when you have time to test afterward â€” not right before a show.

 
 
 
 
 ## If the Update Fails

 
 
 
 
 - Restart both the device and your phone/app.
- Make sure the device isnâ€™t connected to another phone or app.
- Check that your device has enough battery power.
- Try the update again.

If it still fails:

- Refer to the Troubleshooting Guide for additional help.
- Or contact us through the Contact Page.

ðŸ“… How Often Should You Check for Updates?

- The app itself.
- Product Facebook groups.
- Electricks newsletters and website posts.

 
 
 
 
 ## Best Practices for Firmware Updates

 
 
 
 
 - Never update right before a performance.
- Update when you have time to test everything afterward.
- Keep your phone close to the device.
- Make sure the app stays in the foreground.
- Read the update notes first to see whatâ€™s new or changed.
- If you own multiple devices, update them one at a time.
