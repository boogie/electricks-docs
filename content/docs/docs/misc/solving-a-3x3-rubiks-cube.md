# Solving a 3×3 Rubik’s Cube

## 1. Overview

 
 
 
 
 With **43 quintillion** possible scrambled states, a Rubik’s Cube can look intimidating – yet in practice, you can solve it consistently by following just **seven logical stages** and remembering under a dozen short algorithms. Expect your first successful solve in under an hour, and, after practice, times well below one minute.

 
 
 
 
 ## 2. Getting Started

 
 
 
 
 
- **Explore first.** Turn the cube freely and attempt to solve the **white face** without written help. Most people manage this after a little experimentation, and it builds spatial intuition.

- **Learn the notation.** Algorithms are written with single‑letter moves (F, R, U…) plus *’* (counter‑clockwise) or *2*(180°). See Section 4 for a quick reference.

- **Memorise key sequences.** Practise the six main triggers until they flow from muscle memory.

*Tip:* Random twists almost never solve the puzzle. Deliberate patterns are the secret.

 
 
 
 
 ## 3. Cube Anatomy & Good‑to‑Know Facts

 
 
 
 
 

- **Fixed centres** – Each face’s centre never moves; it defines that face’s colour.

- **8 corners** – Three stickers each.

- **12 edges** – Two stickers each.

Understanding that the cube is *built around* its centres helps you keep colours consistent when matching pieces later.

 
 
 
 
 ## 4. Notation at a Glance

 
 
 
 
 

Symbol
Face Turn
Prime (')
Double (2)

**F**
Front
**F’** (CCW)
**F2**

**B**
Back
**B’**
**B2**

**R**
Right
**R’**
**R2**

**L**
Left
**L’**
**L2**

**U**
Up
**U’**
**U2**

**D**
Down
**D’**
**D2**

Hold the cube so **white = Up** and **green = Front** when reading any algorithm.

 
 
 
 
 ## 5. Step‑by‑Step Guide

 
 
 
 
 **Step 1 – White Cross**

Create a plus sign on the white face **with each edge’s side colour matching its adjacent centre**. *Work intuitively.* If an edge flips the wrong way, use **F R D R’ F’**.

**Step 2 – White Corners**

Finish the first layer. Put a white corner beneath its slot, then repeat **R’ D’ R D** until the white sticker is on top. (If the piece is in place but twisted, pop it out first.)

**Step 3 – Second Layer (F2L)**

Turn the cube *upside‑down* (white on bottom). For an edge in the top layer **without yellow**:

- 
**Right insert** (edge goes to the right slot): U R U’ R’ U’ F’ U F

- 
**Left insert** (edge to left slot): U’ L’ U L U F U’ F’

If an edge is in the middle but flipped, run either insert to pop it up, then place correctly.

**Step 4 – Yellow Cross**

With yellow on top, apply **F R U R’ U’ F’**. A *dot* needs 3×, an *L‑shape* 2×, a *line* 1× to reach the cross.

**Step 5 – Position Yellow Edges**

Line up one solved edge with its centre. Hold unsolved edges at **Front** and **Left** and run R U R’ U R U2 R’ U until all four match.

**Step 6 – Place Yellow Corners**

Find a yellow corner that is already in the correct *location* (ignore orientation) and keep it at **Front‑Right‑Up (FRU)**. Use U R U’ L’ U R’ U’ L until all four corners are parked correctly.

**Step 7 – Orient Yellow Corners (Finish)**

Hold an unsolved yellow corner at FRU and repeat **R’ D’ R D** until its yellow sticker is on top. Turn only the **U** layer to bring the next mis‑oriented corner to FRU and repeat. Previously solved layers stay intact.

**Congratulations—cube solved!** If the cube looks scrambled mid‑process, keep faith and continue; only the top layer pieces are moving.

 ## 7. Practice Pointers

 
 
 
 
 

- **Look‑ahead:** Identify the next target piece during the current algorithm.

- **Finger tricks:** Use single‑finger flicks for quick *U*, *R* and *F* turns.

- **Time yourself:** Online timers and phone apps track solves and highlight improvement areas.
