# Tips and Best Practices

This page collects helpful tips and best practices to ensure your Electricks devices perform reliably and help you deliver smooth, stress-free performances.

 
 
 
 
 ## Battery and Charging Tips

 
 
 
 
 - Charge before performances. Always start with a fully charged device to avoid connection drops or power issues.
- Use high-quality chargers. Some cheap USB cables or adapters can cause slow or unreliable charging.
- Check charging contacts. For magnetic chargers or pogo-pin connectors, make sure the contacts are clean and properly aligned.
- Avoid deep discharge. Try not to let batteries run to 0% frequently – it extends battery life.

 
 
 
 
 ## Bluetooth Best Practices

 
 
 
 
 - Disconnect after use. Some devices stay connected after your show. Disconnect manually from the app or phone Bluetooth menu when done.
- Keep devices close. Bluetooth works best within 2–3 meters without obstacles. Metal tables, thick walls, or interference sources can degrade performance.
- One device, one app. A device can only be connected to one phone or app at a time unless specified otherwise (check your product’s compatibility).
- Restart fixes a lot. If something behaves unexpectedly, restart both your device and your phone. This solves most temporary glitches.
- Avoid backgrounding the app. Keep the app in the foreground during performance to prevent disconnections (especially on phones with aggressive battery-saving modes).

 
 
 
 
 ## Device Handling and Usage

 
 
 
 
 - Practice with the device. Familiarize yourself with pairing, modes, buttons, and what happens if a connection drops – before performing.
- Check for firmware updates. Updates often improve stability, fix bugs, and add features. Check your device documentation for update instructions.
- Label your devices. If you own multiple similar devices (e.g., multiple PeekSmiths), label them physically or rename them via Bluetooth settings to avoid confusion.
- Test in the venue. Some venues have more wireless interference. Arrive early to do a quick connection check.

 
 
 
 
 ## Performance Tips

 
 
 
 
 - Have a backup plan. Always be prepared to continue without technology if something unexpected happens (just like any other magic prop).
- Learn manual modes. Many devices have standalone or backup modes that don’t require a phone – know how to use them.
- Don’t rely on Wi-Fi. Our devices use Bluetooth – Wi-Fi isn’t needed unless specified by the app (and Wi-Fi in venues can be unreliable).
- Keep it simple. The best routines are designed so that even if a display isn’t perfect (for example, the PeekSmith is in a bag), the routine still works.

 
 
 
 
 ## App and Phone Settings

 
 
 
 
 - Disable battery optimization. On Android especially, disable battery optimization for your magic apps to prevent disconnections.
- Enable Bluetooth permissions. iOS and Android may block Bluetooth if permissions are not granted – check app settings.
- Update your apps. App updates fix bugs and improve compatibility with the latest devices.
- Silence notifications. Put your phone on Do Not Disturb to avoid unexpected notifications during performances.

 
 
 
 
 ## Storage and Maintenance

 
 
 
 
 - Power off when not in use. This preserves battery life and avoids accidental connections.
- Keep devices in dry, clean environments. Avoid moisture, dust, and extreme temperatures.
- Use cases or pouches. Devices with screens (like PeekSmith) or delicate parts stay safer when stored in protective cases.

 
 
 
 
 ## Good Habits Checklist

 
 
 
 
 - Charged the device fully before performance.
- Verified Bluetooth connection and app functionality.
- Updated firmware and apps.
- Disabled battery optimization (Android).
- Put phone in Do Not Disturb mode.
- Tested in the venue.
- Have a backup plan ready.
