# How to Report an Issue

## Before You Contact Support

 
 
 
 
 To help us solve your problem as quickly as possible, please include detailed information when reporting an issue.

Messages like:

“It’s not working.”

or

“I’ve tried everything.”

are not helpful – and will delay finding a solution.

When reporting a problem, please include:

- Which device and app you are using (include version numbers if possible).
- A clear description of the problem. What happens? What did you expect to happen?
- Steps to reproduce the issue, if possible.
- What you have tried so far (for example: rebooting, updating firmware, changing cables).
- Screenshots or photos of error messages, device screens, or connection status.
- For Bluetooth issues: your phone model and operating system version.
- For app crashes: describe what you were doing when it happened.

This information allows us to help much faster – often with just one reply.

You can report issues through our Contact Page: https://electricks.info/contact-us/

Example: Good vs. Bad Report

❌ Bad Report:

“PeekSmith not working.”

✅ Good Report:

“My PeekSmith 3 doesn’t connect to the PeekSmith app on iPhone 13 Pro, iOS 17.4. Bluetooth is on, and the app sees the device but fails to connect. I tried restarting both devices, turning Bluetooth off and on, and reinstalling the app. Firmware is version 1.4.2. Screenshot attached.”
