# Troubleshooting Guide

Welcome to the Electricks Troubleshooting Guide. If you’re experiencing an issue, this guide will help you solve the most common problems related to connectivity, charging, firmware, apps, and usage.

 
 
 
 
 ## Connectivity Issues

 
 
 
 
 My device won’t connect over Bluetooth.

- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone or tablet.
- Make sure the device is powered on.
- The device may already be connected to another phone or app. Disconnect it from others first.
- Restart both the device and your phone.
- Refer to the Bluetooth Connection Guide for your device.

The device disconnects randomly.

- Check battery levels – low battery can cause disconnections.
- Keep the device close to the phone (within a few meters).
- Avoid interference from Wi-Fi routers, metal objects, or other electronics.
- Make sure your app is running in the foreground and not closed by power-saving settings.

 
 
 
 
 ## Power & Charging

 
 
 
 
 How do I know if the device needs charging?

- Check the battery indicator on the app or device screen (if supported).
- Some devices vibrate or blink when the battery is low.

My device isn’t charging.

- Use a known-good cable and charger.
- Check for dust or debris in the charging port.
- Make sure the charging pins are aligned correctly (especially for magnetic chargers).
- Try another USB power source.
- If the device still won’t charge, contact support.

 
 
 
 
 ## Firmware & Updates

 
 
 
 
 How do I update the firmware?

- Follow the firmware update guide for your product.
- Keep the device close to your phone during the update.
- Ensure the device is charged above 50% before starting.

The firmware update failed. What now?

- Restart the device and the app.
- Retry the update.
- Check Bluetooth connection stability.
- If it still fails, refer to the Firmware Troubleshooting section in your device guide or contact support.

 
 
 
 
 ## App Issues

 
 
 
 
 The app doesn’t detect my device.

- Make sure Bluetooth permissions are granted to the app.
- Restart the app and the device.
- Check that no other app is connected to the device.

The app crashes or behaves strangely.

- Check for app updates in the App Store or Google Play.

 ## Usage Issues

 
 
 
 
 Are the devices examinable during performances?
