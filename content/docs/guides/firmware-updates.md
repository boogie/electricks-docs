## Automatic Updates

### Current Status

Electricks devices currently require manual updates. We don't push automatic updates to ensure you control when updates happen.

### Future

We're considering optional automatic updates with:
- User control (can disable)
- Performance scheduling (never during shows)
- Small patches auto, major versions manual
- Notification before auto-update

## Multiple Devices

### Updating Multiple Devices

If you own several Electricks devices:

1. **Update one at a time**
   - Don't try simultaneous updates
   - Complete one before starting next
   - Avoid interference

2. **Keep track**
   - Note which devices updated
   - Track versions in a list
   - Update oldest firmware first

3. **Staged approach**
   - Update non-critical device first
   - Test for a few days
   - Then update performance devices
